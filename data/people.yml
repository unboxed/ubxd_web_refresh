    I founded and run Unboxed Consulting, an Agile Enterprise Ruby on Rails System Integrator. I enjoy stimulating ideas, shaping the company and looking for ways to improve ourselves. I am also interested in Lean Startup and Startup Weekends.
    In my spare time I am setting up a charity for pupils to attend Hilton College.
    I was named 'Best Agile Coach or Mentor (Process)' at the 2014 UK Agile Awards.

    I believe building software is the most complex endeavor humans have set themselves to do. At Unboxed I get to do it with smart people who really value working in an Agile manner. And this is all a lot more fun than the world of financial risk management where I started my career.

    As a contributor to Ruby on Rails since 2007 and a core team member since 2012 I really enjoy helping people with their Rails problems and working at Unboxed gives me a great opportunity to do that, both with the great developers we have here and with our clients.
    I also like to help to the new generation of Rails programmers and as part of that I mentor students from across the world as part of the Facebook OpenAcademy and Google Summer of Code programs.

    I have been around a long time, having now spent nigh on thirty years working on projects. Starting first as a developer using COBOL(!), moving onto Visual Basic and Forte. After a few years I moved into more analytical, people management and project management roles, so have seen a lot of issues that projects face. Having started work in a truly waterfall manner it is refreshing to now be part of a company that not only talks about Agile but does it, properly.
    I enjoy running and socialising - and find that the two go well together!

    I have grown up with Unboxed Consulting where we have learned to embrace change that is defined by the user. I swapped working in the PMO for working as a part of a team as a Scrum Master and then as a Tester. I pivoted again, changing focus from the end user of digital products to concentrate on the people who are involved in delighting end users. Being a "Gardener" is my analogy for cultivating an environment in which talent can thrive and great ideas grow into products that add more colour to life.

    There’s only so much a developer can do on their own, even when supplied with a bottomless cup of Darjeeling and all the Scottish indie-pop their ears desire. At least, that’s what I’ve learned in my years as a web developer and why I joined Unboxed Consulting. It’s a great team of smart people with an amazing focus on agile development processes and I'm glad to be a part of it.

    I'm a huge geek, with an overly-keen eye for detail, a truly terrible taste in music and a severely lacking knowledge of films. I found my love for development around the age of 16 and since progressed to study Software Engineering at Imperial College, London. I started as an intern at Unboxed in the third year of my degree, and found it so much more rewarding than being at Uni!

Following this success I have been producing portfolio websites for small local companies and ever since I have been eager to develop this passion further. This has been made possible by joining Unboxed Consulting.

    I began by studying rocks and found my love of code later. I’ve moved from the world of scientific desktop software to web development using open source. My goal is to be the best developer I can be and for me this means being part of an active and stimulating community, something that Unboxed and the web development community as a whole provides in spades.
    Away from a desk, I enjoy running, climbing and cooking tasty grub (or at least attempts at these)

    I cut my teeth on a massive Open Source roll out in South Africa, with a split focus between development and dev-ops. It became obvious that I enjoyed the development side far more. So here I am now, at Unboxed, to focus my time on energy on what I enjoy the most.
    In my off time I enjoy the outdoors, having a braai, watching documentaries and finding new music.

    My whole career has been in software, and I love it when a system goes live, making a positive impact on the lives and work of its users.
    Scrum first appeared on my radar in 2010 and changed the way I think about software delivery forever. Then in 2012 I read The Lean Startup, which cemented my change in thinking.
    I’m over the moon to have cast-off the role of a traditional project manager and joined Unboxed as a Scrum Master, to work with exceptional people and deliver exciting projects.
    When I’m not working, I can often be found with a camera in-hand and am always up for a conversation about photography.
