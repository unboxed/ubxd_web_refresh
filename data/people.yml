    I founded and run Unboxed Consulting, an Agile Enterprise Ruby on Rails System Integrator. I enjoy stimulating ideas, shaping the company and looking for ways to improve ourselves. I am also interested in Lean Startup and Startup Weekends.
    In my spare time I am setting up a charity for pupils to attend Hilton College.
    I was named 'Best Agile Coach or Mentor (Process)' at the 2014 UK Agile Awards.

    As a contributor to Ruby on Rails since 2007 and a core team member since 2012 I really enjoy helping people with their Rails problems and working at Unboxed gives me a great opportunity to do that, both with the great developers we have here and with our clients.
    I also like to help to the new generation of Rails programmers and as part of that I mentor students from across the world as part of the Facebook OpenAcademy and Google Summer of Code programs.

    I have been around a long time, having now spent nigh on thirty years working on projects. Starting first as a developer using COBOL(!), moving onto Visual Basic and Forte. After a few years I moved into more analytical, people management and project management roles, so have seen a lot of issues that projects face. Having started work in a truly waterfall manner it is refreshing to now be part of a company that not only talks about Agile but does it, properly.
    I enjoy running and socialising - and find that the two go well together!

    I connect Unboxed with the big wide world and help the business grow. I'm an ideas factory and I love digital products, information design, lean start up and 'making stuff'.
    My other love is running - track and cross country. Some people say I have too much energy. It's possible...

    Ten years ago I started my first job - shoring up a failing project in a failing
    dot com. Ever since then I've been helping people with projects that are in trouble,
    and in doing so, learnt a lot about agile methods and how they can help a struggling
    project. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find us,
    maybe you can hire... unboxed

    I am a Developer here at Unboxed. After a past career in animation and visual
    effects I was lured away by a fascination with the web with its dramatic effect
    on culture and business. I think we live in exciting times!

    My whole career has been in software, and I love it when a system goes live, making a positive impact on the lives and work of its users.
    Scrum first appeared on my radar in 2010 and changed the way I think about software delivery forever. Then in 2012 I read The Lean Startup, which cemented my change in thinking.
    I'm over the moon to have cast-off the role of a traditional project manager and joined Unboxed as a Scrum Master, to work with exceptional people and deliver exciting projects.
    When I'm not working, I can often be found with a camera in-hand and am always up for a conversation about photography.
