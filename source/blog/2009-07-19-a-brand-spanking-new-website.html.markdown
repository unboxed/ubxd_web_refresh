<p>Unboxed Consulting is a forward-thinking, innovative bunch of people with fresh modern ideas and unwavering professionalism on everything from building great websites and IT applications to making world-class cups of coffee! Needless to say, a company like this needs a website to match!</p>
<p>So how do you solve a problem like the Unboxed Consulting website?</p>
<p>There is a formula for creating the perfect contemporary brand. The secret lies in the feel of the communication and tone of the message. The key is to strike the perfect balance between personality and professionalism, fun and actually knowing what you&rsquo;re talking about and seeing it through. The ideal contemporary brand needs to embrace the modern ethos of having a friendly, warm and approachable image mixed with classic old-fashioned professionalism, unwavering quality and expertise. It sounds so simple&hellip; but why do so many people get it so wrong? Remember, we&rsquo;re not talking pretty aesthetics; we&rsquo;re talking trust, confidence, success or failure.</p>
<p>The key ingredients for this saucy dish include: Apex, a tasteful sans serif typeface with enough personality to separate it from the contemporary design default Helvetica. Pantone 254M or &lsquo;Purple&rsquo;, and our new cartoon men, a visual signifier of childlike innocence and fun to offset any crisp typography or straight talking content that might scare people away!</p>
<p>White space is very important too. Clean, considered design allows the user&rsquo;s eye to digest so much more of the communication on the page, and remember- EVERYTHING communicates, whether you like it or not, so be aware and engineer that message as best you can! Soft edges and rounded corners add a feminine elegance to juxtapose with the masculine IT stereotype, also adding a vibe of accessibility and ease of use.</p>
<p>To finish off, illustrations of the team - the friendly human face of Unboxed Consulting, carefully positioned within the frame to give the site the illusion of spatial depth and size.</p>
<p>And there you have it, a short synopsis on the thinking behind Unboxed Consulting&rsquo;s fancy new look. If you&rsquo;d like to know more get in touch and we&rsquo;d be happy to help.</p>
