  <li>Search for office space from the Waterfront to Muizenberg and settle on a great and gorgeously located building in Constantia close to some superb vineyards, the names of which are a challenge (for some) to pronounce. Uitsig anyone?</li>
  <li>Tear down dividing walls and create some open plan space.</li>
  <li>Throw in a re-designed kitchen and bar stools.</li>
  <li>Recruit a posse of ninja coders.</li>
  <li>Add a spoonful of va va voom.</li>
  <li>Place some very temporary tables, chairs, sofa and coffee table in to the mix to get up and running.</li>
  <li>Go shopping for generous portions of kit not forgetting a tablespoon of VOIP telephony.</li>
  <li>Rejoice in the arrival of a container from the old country containing IKEA desks and bookcases, a meeting room table and chairs so comfortable it's hard saying goodbye. And lastly but definitely most importantly, a coffee machine that rocks.</li>
  <li>Film the above for another blog post arriving shortly.</li>
  <li>Blend in the sites and sounds of a hip and happening city and for icing on top, throw in a World Cup for good measure. Go Engerland. Go Bafana Bafana.</li>
