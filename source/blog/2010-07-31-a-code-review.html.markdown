<p>We have had a code review carried out on one of the projects we are currently working on,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.channel5.com">channel5.com</a>, by an external party.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.hashref.com">Xavier Noria</a> has looked at the code and has given us a glowing report which Channel 5 are very happy with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overriding conclusion of the report is that &#39;<em>The quality of the reviewed source code is very good, it uses idiomatic Ruby and idiomatic Rails, and overall it follows best practices&#39;.</em></p>
<p>Additionally, Xavier makes some suggestions that we will be applying to future developments.</p>
