<p>I was driving the family back from Lucca in Tuscany to catch our flight from Genova when a thought struck me. Car manufacturers segment their markets looking for large niches. &nbsp;Large enough to attract enough customers worldwide but unique enough to differentiate themselves from the competition. &nbsp;I have sat with customers as they try to define the tone and style of their website. We often work with customers who are building a website from scratch so we are working from a blank canvas which in some ways makes things easier but usually the brand identity and site functionality emerge together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want a quality brand and we want that to come across in our website&rdquo; our customer will say. This is where my new idea comes in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your site was a car, what car would it be and what colour would it be?&rdquo; I proffer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, our product is the best!&rdquo; counter the customer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are we talking Rolls Royce or Bugatti Veyron?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well those cars are in an inaccessible league that very few can afford. &nbsp;Our site offers value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So how about a Mercedes S class or BMW 7 series?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those cars are executive cars, we are selling to middle class families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larger families, with older parents? &nbsp;How about a Volvo XC90 or a Audi Q7&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. &nbsp;Our family would be ecologically friendly. &nbsp;They would drive the Lexus 400h Hybrid. &nbsp;In black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! &nbsp;Our site is a black Lexus 400h.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wonder if there is a way to reference the Toyota Way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your site was a car, what car would it be? &nbsp;What car is our Unboxed Consulting site? &nbsp;A convertible VW Beetle with custom painted flowers or the Audi S4 in charcoal?</p>
