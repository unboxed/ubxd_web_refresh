<p>It dawned on me this week that sometimes seeking out new business can be a bit like asking out a girl out on a hot date! Cold sweats, nervous shivers, butterflies in the stomach; a total nightmare... right?!</p>
<p><br />
This week I went along to the <a href="http://www.freshbusinessthinking.com/" target="_blank">freshbusinessthinking.com</a> event in London. Thousands of directors and reps from SMEs all over the UK, all in one room, at the same time - yowzer! Practically a speed dating extravaganza; latt&eacute;s were drunk, details were exchanged, telephone numbers and business cards being passed around willy nilly with no protection and not even a kiss goodbye. The thought in everyones&rsquo; minds was: could this person be good for me, could I be good for them, and darn they&rsquo;ve got beautiful eyes!<br />
<br />
THAT IS until I saw that ex-supermodel and business entrepeneur Caprice Bourret was on the bill, talking about her lingerie business and the tough road from clothes horse to clothes designer. She sells her wares (underwares- geddit?) on <a href="http://www.debenhams.com/" target="_blank">debenhams.com</a>, <a href="http://www.figleaves.com/uk/home.asp" target="_blank">figleaves.com</a> and <a href="http://www.asos.com/" target="_blank">asos.com</a>, but still has no website of her own, whether it be a full ecommerce website or just an online catalogue of her range.<br />
<br />
Eureka! I design websites + she needs a website = I should go and speak to her. So there I was, I thrust my salmon bagel and black coffee to the nearest fellow and said, &ldquo;hold on to these baby... I&rsquo;m going to go and chat up Caprice!&rdquo; I hadn&rsquo;t felt so stupid since I was 16 years old in the school playground, but I did get a moment of her time, gave her my card and she said, &ldquo;awww thanks Tooooooommmm, I&rsquo;ll check out ur stuff,&rdquo; in a very ex-model, big in the nineties, Californian celeb type way. And then she was gone. *sigh*<br />
<br />
Well, I&rsquo;m still waiting and the phone hasn&rsquo;t rung. But I guess there are plenty more fish in the sea...</p>
