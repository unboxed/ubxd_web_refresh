<p>I was wondering why a lot of people still don&#39;t want to pair program. So I wrote down my most important reasons why you should pair program. Btw if you don&#39;t know what pair programming is, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">here is the explanation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Faster learning</strong> - if you pair program with a more experienced developer you will learn much faster than you would alone.</p>
<p><strong>Faster development</strong> - Even though sometimes pair programming may be slower (pair senior / junior), in general it&#39;s faster. Two people working on the same issue have different ideas on how to solve the problem or they can suggest better and faster solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Learn new things</strong> - It doesn&#39;t matter if you pair with a skilled or beginner developer. Every person thinks differently so you will learn new techniques or even just different approaches on how to solve the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Better understanding of code</strong> - If you pair program you have to explain what are you writing and why. That will help you think more about problems and their solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaner code</strong> - Pair programming usually forces you to write cleaner code, because you are watched and you don&#39;t want to look like bad programmer, do you?</p>
<p><strong>Bus factor</strong> - Pair programming helps you increase the number of people that could be &quot;hit by a bus&quot; without affecting productivity, i.e. more people have knowledge of the code base. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">Bus factor explanation</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Eyes will rest</strong> - Yes this is good reason too. If you pair program you usually don&#39;t stare at the monitor for long intervals (which help your eyes), because you have discussions with your co-worker, about the issue, that you are solving.</p>
<p>So are you finally convinced to pair program ?</p>
