<p>Forget Pro-Plus or extra strong coffees, you don&#39;t need this or a trip down to Spec-Savers to help keep focus.&nbsp; The answer is agile.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not going to speak for other devs, but I have a seriously overactive mind.&nbsp; Just as I get into &#39;the zone&#39;, I&#39;ll suddenly remember a piece of code I marked to refactor, or think of a&nbsp; good approach to solve that issue with the Javascript popups, or maybe even I&#39;ll remember it&#39;s my wife&#39;s birthday in 2 weeks and I still haven&#39;t decided what to get her.&nbsp; Just like that, I&#39;m out of the zone; I have to go back, re-read where I am, and repaint that mental picture of what I&#39;m trying to achieve. I&#39;d guess this is something all developers experience quite regularly.</p>
<p>So what&#39;s the answer. Maybe spend 3 years on a Tibetan mountain in deep meditation to improve concentration.&nbsp; Perhaps one of those herbal teas would work? Or maybe some form of lobotomy would prevent these lapses of concentration&hellip;&nbsp; To be honest, if I was able to give myself perfect concentration I would never remember to get my wife a birthday present.&nbsp; I think the real answer is to find a way to get back into the zone as quickly as possible once focus has been lost.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s where agile helps. When working in an agile way, you are always working on a story.&nbsp; If you lost clarity about what you&#39;re trying to achieve, you simply go and pick up the card, read the acceptance criteria again, and quite suddenly you&#39;re ready to go again.&nbsp; Additionally, you&#39;re only allowed to work on the story in-front of you, so you can&#39;t be distracted by stuff outside the scope of the story.</p>
<p>Another valuable tool for regaining focus is cucumber.&nbsp; We write up a user journey in cucumber first, and if you forget where you had got to, all you need to do is run that feature and you&#39;re told what to do next in big red letters.</p>
<p>So, in summary, an agile developer is better at retaining focus than a Tibetan monk&hellip; no really!</p>
