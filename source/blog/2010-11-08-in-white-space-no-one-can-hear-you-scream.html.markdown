<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.&rdquo; Leonardo Da Vinci<br />
<br />
On my travels through cyberspace this week I hit upon this spooky website...<br />
<br />
<a href="http://yvettesbridalformal.com">&nbsp;http://yvettesbridalformal.com/</a><br />
<br />
It reminded me of a serious and consistent gripe I&rsquo;ve had for a long time with the world of bad design that seems able to exist online, but surely could never be allowed to exist in the real world... could it?<br />
<br />
It concerns the importance of white space in design, one of the key and fundamental principles of visual composition. When considerately applied by artists and designers, they can achieve a harmonious balance to the human eye. It&rsquo;s the difference between positive and negative, something and nothing. It&rsquo;s not easy to do well; some people are great at it, others are complete rubbish, but who cares? Why is it so important?<br />
<br />
Well... It&rsquo;s not the emphasis of form over function for design work to look as good as it can. It&rsquo;s critical for graphic design - where the function is to communicate - that the form can allow this to happen effectively. The form is the refinement of the communication, the tone of the client&rsquo;s voice to their audience, articulated by the designer.<br />
<br />
White space can let the important bits - the content and corresponding message - breathe. It can make the dullest piece of work look elegant and considered, or help the weakest line of copy pack more of a punch than it did before.<br />
<br />
In the context of website design, an informed use of white space can provide a contrast where the messages and elements on the page become simultaneously more striking and easier for the user to take in.<br />
<br />
Saying - less - clearly - means more than trying to SAYINGEVERYTHINGLOUDLYALLATONCE!!!!<br />
<br />
Your key messages can suddenly be heard through all the noise, your key areas of interest can suddenly be found amongst all the clutter. Advertising becomes more clear, and in turn, your business reach and appeal can increase.<br />
