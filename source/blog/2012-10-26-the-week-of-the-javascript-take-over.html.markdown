## Tri-state booleans

Ever heard of a tri-state boolean with 5 possible values, 3 of which are unsupported?
I hadn't until a few minutes ago. Details located at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa432714(office.12).aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa432714\(office.12\).aspx). Another one to file under the sick-and-wrong category.

Here's another link - this time one to file under the "impressive" folder:
## How to Sort One Million 8-digit Numbers in 1MB of RAM

## Renaming indexes in ActiveRecord:

One of the things I found which is available from Rails 3 is the rename_index method.

So if you have changed a column name which you are indexing on simply add the following to your migration

    rename_index :table_name, 'old_name', 'new_name'


Please note: this may also work with symbols! I haven't a clue!

***Matt F has been mourning the passing of CEEFAX***
## Twefax
[http://jonathancresswell.co.uk/twefax/](http://jonathancresswell.co.uk/twefax/) has been consoling me in this dark, terrifying post-CEEFAX world. It's built using Fork-A-Twitter-Client

## RubyWeaver
Sadly [http://rubyweaver.js-designz.net/](http://rubyweaver.js-designz.net/) needs some tlc.  Any takers?
