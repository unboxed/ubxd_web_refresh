We've got a lot to get through this week, so let's get started;

## 2012 Rails Rumble winners… (Lee)
We start off this week's post with the results of the recent Rails Rumble contest:
[http://railsrumble.com/entries/winners](http://railsrumble.com/entries/winners)

## .. and the winners' perferred choice of gem
Dwellable have written up a nice breakdown of the gems used by this year's Rails Rumble winners:

## On upgrading to Rails 4 (Lee)
One of the significant new changes in Rails 4 is strong parameters, which can apparently easily be included in your Rails 3 app. Here's a more in-depth look.

## Ruby 2.0.0-preview1 released
Exactly what it says on the tin. With 10% more Japanese.

## Ruby 2.0 patch promises to make Rails faster (Leo)
So there's a Ruby 2.0 patch that promises to make Rails startup 2.2x faster. Unsurprisingly, it revolves around optimising the "require" keyword. It sounds very promising and definitely worth a read.

## Jolyon's found something interesting on mocking
Using mocks in our Rails tests hasn't always produced elegant and highly maintainable test code. The assumption was that there must be a better way and no doubt there is room for improvement but having watched Justin Searls' talk [To Mock or Not to Mock](http://confreaks.com/videos/1255-rockymtnruby2012-to-mock-or-not-to-mock), it looks as if Rails + mocking is in no way a walk in the park.

## Honeybadger.io
For those that weren't enticed enough to click the Rails Rumble link above; here's Honeybadger, pitched to me as a 'cheaper and better alternative to Airbrake'. Is it any good? I have no idea. Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.

For those who like lists of new tools to try out: [http://carpeaqua.com/2012/10/15/my-ultimate-developer-and-power-users-tool-list-for-mac-os-x-2012-edition-/](http://carpeaqua.com/2012/10/15/my-ultimate-developer-and-power-users-tool-list-for-mac-os-x-2012-edition-/)

## 'Trimming the fat' - Paul Robert Lloyd
Nice case study of the steps taken by the OP to optimise the performance of his site: [http://paulrobertlloyd.com/2012/11/trimming_the_fat/](http://paulrobertlloyd.com/2012/11/trimming_the_fat/)

### [INTERVAL!]
Well that was exciting wasn't it? Let's take a little break. Just sit back, put your feet up and enjoy the contributed [kitten GIF gallery](http://imgur.com/a/RnF6j) for a few minutes. We'll wait for you here, see you in a bit. Just ignore that some people can't tell the difference between gifs and jpgs…

## ::Wireframing App Of The Week::
Continuing our semi-regular feature: [wireframe.cc](http://wireframe.cc)

## book: "Ruby Under a Microscope" (Matt Peperell)
Typically when using a program language we don't about the details of the underlying implementation.  But what about those cases when we do care? The newly published book "__Ruby Under a Microscope__" should sate those needs. Available in _PDF_, _EPUB_ and _MOBI_ formats, you can find details at [http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope)

## editor plugin: Emmet
Previously known as the web development toolkit _Zen Coding_, [Emmet](http://docs.emmet.io/) has been released with improved parsing and range of snippets. Basically, it's a way to type CSS-like expressions in your editor and produce expanded markup. It is compatible with most major editors.

## …and something for the Vim users
In the interests of balance, I found something for Vim as well; [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) - think Bundler for Vim and you're basically there.
