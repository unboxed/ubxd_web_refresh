## ActiveSupport method of the week File#atomic_write (thanks to Leo)
<code>atomic_write(file_name, temp_dir = Dir.tmpdir)</code>

Write to a file atomically. Useful for situations where you don’t want other processes or threads to see half-written files.

    File.atomic_write("important.file") do |file|
      file.write("hello")
    end


If your temp directory is not on the same filesystem as the file you’re trying to write, you can provide a different temporary directory.

    File.atomic_write("/data/something.important", "/data/tmp") do |file|
      file.write("hello")
    end
