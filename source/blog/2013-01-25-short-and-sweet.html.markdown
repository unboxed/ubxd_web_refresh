##Silly people publishing their RSA keys (Matt P)

Top top of the day: do not publish your private RSA key. A tweet doings the rounds recently, highlighted the fact that lots of people have submitted their private key to github repos.  Github have since masked the results, but you can still get a plethora of hits in Google.
