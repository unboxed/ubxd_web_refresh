title: "New Apprentices - Abbie & Tillie"
author: "Abbie Ferguson"

We started Unboxed on 18th February 2013, Abbie as a marketing apprentice and Tillie as a sales apprentice. We are very excited about getting involved with the company and progressing throughout our one year placement. We were in MiddletonMurray's pre-apprenticeship scheme and from here Unboxed Consulting came to employ candidates and we were lucky enough to be chosen. Whilst at MiddletonMurray we gained 2 BTEC qualifications, in customer service and work skills. We had to write pitches to say to the employer, which were about ourselves. This helped us gain a lot of confidence. They also taught us interview techniques before the companies started coming in to interview us. We then started at Unboxed Consulting where on our first day we learnt more about the company structure and how it works, we met all of the staff and got ourselves set up on laptops. On our second day we posted information about ourselves on the website and are currently working on getting our caricatures up on the website. We also sat in on a telephone meeting with Sarah, who was talking to people about an upcoming event. We are looking forward to progressing within the company and completing our NVQ in Business & Administration.
