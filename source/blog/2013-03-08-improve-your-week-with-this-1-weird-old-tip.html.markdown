Ok, so it's more like 16 perfectly normal new tips.  Sorry for misleading you.  Anyway here they are:


Tips from Matt P
------------------

### Software bloat

[http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html](http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html)

People often complain about software bloat. Sometimes this complaining is even justified.  Here is an article from at least as far back as 2006 (I've been unable to find an original publication date) which delves deep into the ELF binary format in order to see just how small a functional program can be on a GNU/Linux system. I sated my curiousity, and perhaps pre-empted a question: yes, the techniques do still work on a modern system.

### Kaleidoscopes

2. [http://www.ro.me/film](http://www.ro.me/film)

   Having seen this, the previous kaleidoscope link pales in comparison.  This awesome display is done entirely in HTML5, WebGL, Javascript etc. - no plugins needed.

### When random isn't

[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15182496/why-does-this-code-print-hello-world](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15182496/why-does-this-code-print-hello-world)

This stackoverflow article delves into Java's [Random()](http://www.docjar.com/docs/api/java/util/Random.html) behaviour and how it can be abused.  File this one under the sick-and-wrong category. (It's been a while since I've provided such a link.)

### RDD?

First there was TDD. Then BDD.  Now comes [RDD](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)
Andrew and I found this when researching the changes going into [CanCan 2.0](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/tree/2.0)

### [Rails Girls London](http://railsgirls.com/london)

Rails Girls is a global movement to teach coding and web development using rails to women.  The first London meeting is scheduled for 20th April and they're looking for volunteers and coaches.   Probably also looking for attendees, so spread the word and get involved.

### A great ruby talk

[https://speakerdeck.com/jeg2/10-things-you-didnt-know-ruby-could-do](https://speakerdeck.com/jeg2/10-things-you-didnt-know-ruby-could-do)

Don't let the title fool you, there are about 100 snippets of code in this set of slides from the Aloha Ruby Conf in Hawaii.  Goes over syntax you didn't know about, core library features you often forget, and delves into the esoteric stuff in the standard library.  Really good, if a little dense and each slide is quite brief, probably best to run through it with irb open so you can try it out as you go.

A tip from Jolyon P
---------------------

Why leave agility moping in the corner of the office when you leave for the day if you can take it home and start a [revolution](http://www.ted.com/talks/bruce_feiler_agile_programming_for_your_family.html)?
