[Public Domain is not Open Source](http://opensource.org/faq#public-domain)

I have a personal preference for not putting a license on software, because there are too many debates to be had about which is the "best" OSS license.  Until now, if asked I'd just say my stuff is public domain, or at a push, [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0).  Turns out that according to the above (admittedly biased) [FAQ](http://opensource.org/faq#public-domain) this decision might be a bad one, and they suggest that [CC0](http://opensource.org/faq#cc-zero) isn't good enough either.

[unlicense](http://unlicense.org/) do provide an opposing point of view which I thought would be convincing given my preference going in, but having read the OSI explanation I found, to my surprise, I was unconvinced.  So now I have to think [about which license](http://opensource.org/licenses) I do want to use that gives *me* enough "don't blame me if you die" cover and *you* enough "you can use it for whatever you want" confidence.  It's [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) isn't it?

###The single most useful thing in bash
Or so the title of [this blog post](https://coderwall.com/p/oqtj8w) claims. Ever wanted to scroll through partial matches in your bash history? Now you can.

###Minifesto

Billed as a "Manifesto for Minimalist Software Engineers", here is another summary of some lean workflow principles. Having read through it, we already do a lot of this at Unboxed Consulting, but it's still an interesting read.

###Style police!
[The Ruby style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) is well known and followed by many.

Here's a software tool  to tell you when you're falling foul of the recommendations. Just what you always wanted!

###The Underhanded C Contest
Normally we aim to write well-behaved software.  Here's a chance to be a first-world anarchist, and write some software which is subtly ill-behaved.  This year's challenge is a social networking application. The competition runs until June 4th.
