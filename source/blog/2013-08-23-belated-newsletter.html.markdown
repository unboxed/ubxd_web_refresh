## An insight into Twitter's scaling
Though they now use multiple other technologies, it's relatively well known in the rails community that Twitter started off as a rails site.

The engineering blog is fascinating, and this post https://blog.twitter.com/2013/new-tweets-per-second-record-and-how explains how they've overcome some of the scaling difficulties.

## Viewport-based text sizing
CSS3 has some new values for sizing things relative to the current viewport size: vw, vh, and vmin. Whilst bleeding-edge at present (available in Chrome 20+, Safari 6+, IE 10+, Firefox 19+). But what are these units? They are for laying out text (text size and line width) relevant to the viewport size. Details at http://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/
