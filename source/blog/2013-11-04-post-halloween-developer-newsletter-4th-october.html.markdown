## Starlogs - MattP
[Starlogs.net](http://starlogs.net/)

Starlogs is a toy for github projects.  Give it a project owner and project, and see the commits rendered in the style of the Star Wars story. There's even a predictable theme tune.  Here's what it looks like for the devise authentication library: http://starlogs.net/#plataformatec/devise

## Lean anti-patterns - Sven A

[Lean Enterprise Anti-Pattern: The Lean Waterfall](http://grasshopperherder.com/lean-startup-in-the-enterprise-anti-pattern-the-lean-waterfall/)

I find the ideas around segmented iterative development being an anti-pattern quite eye-opening because it suggests that ultimately we're only effective as an Agile company when our clients experience significant push-back into their own planning and product development cycles…

## “The Ultimate guide to learning AngularJS in one day” - Rich A

[This post](http://toddmotto.com/ultimate-guide-to-learning-angular-js-in-one-day/) is a great introduction to the larger concepts around AngularJS. It's a little lacking on the testing side of things, which I find to be one of Angular's greater strengths, but it's a great read with thorough examples throughout.

## Snap.svg - Rich A

[snap.svg](http://snapsvg.io/)

Yes, it's yet another SVG library, no it doesn't fallback to IE8, but it does focus more on the animation/interaction side of things, and it is simple enough to get up and running in a few minutes. Give it a go.


## The Parable of Mustache.js - [Murray](/people#murray-steele)

[Jan Lenhardt](http://jan.prima.de/) has written [a great article](http://writing.jan.io/2013/11/01/the-parable-of-mustache-js.html) about the history of [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js).  On the face of it he's written an interesting look back on why he wrote mustache.js, and how to cope with others advancing your work via forks.  What I mainly took away from it however is his point that often there is no one true implementation of an idea.  Extracting specs from the original allows multiple implementations of an it to exist to cover different purposes.  For example: Mustache itself has been implemented in [multiple languages](http://mustache.github.io/), and within JS it's been [implemented](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) [multiple](http://handlebarsjs.com/) [times](http://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/); all of these serve slightly different purposes, and that's ok!
