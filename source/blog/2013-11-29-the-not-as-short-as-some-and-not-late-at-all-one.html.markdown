### Ruby Manor 4.0 Videos - [Murray](/people#murray-steele)

[Ruby Manor 4.0 videos on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/album/2596602)

I helped run the [Ruby Manor 4.0](http://rubymanor.org/4) conference way back in April and we’ve *finally* released the videos of all the talks.  I won’t bore you with why it took 7 months to get them out; but let’s just say I never want to see a JVC camera, miniDV tape, or cheap VGA frame grabber again.  It was worth it though as there’s something for everyone in those 8 talks.  Please do [check them out](http://vimeo.com/album/2596602)!
