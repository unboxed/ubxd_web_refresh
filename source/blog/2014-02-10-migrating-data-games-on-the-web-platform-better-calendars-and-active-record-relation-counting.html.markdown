## Migrating live data is a pain, use this gem to make it simpler - Tom Russell
A [gem](https://github.com/ajvargo/data-migrate) by [Andrew J Vargo](https://github.com/ajvargo) that aims to make live data migrations less scary. Find it here: https://github.com/ajvargo/data-migrate

## A better Calendar for all - Francesca Granato

A note from Francesca : "I think the design is strong, the screen real estate is well-used, the UI is almost entirely gesture-based and the underlying premise of the app challenges the way we use calendars on our phones. Its worth checking out (although it isn't free). "

This is an awesome app and we could gain a lot from looking at it's gesture based interface.

## How many relations could an active record model have if an active record model could chuck wood? - Jolyon Pawlyn

From Jolyon: "A second project had a requirement to display a most related models section, or even a third project if you count the 'Related Blog Posts' section on this site. A good candidate for a gem, so as a starter for 10 we have [most_related](https://github.com/jpawlyn/most_related)."
