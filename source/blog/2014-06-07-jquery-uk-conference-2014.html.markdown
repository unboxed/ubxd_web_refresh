Chris C, Veronika H and I attended jQuery's 2014 conference in Oxford. Between the three of us, we could cover quite a lot of different talks that were available on the day. This blog post is just a slice of some of the talks we attended that day.

[Jen Simmons](http://twitter.com/jensimmons) began the conference by presenting [A Love Letter to HTML](https://speakerdeck.com/jensimmons/a-love-letter-to-html-a-keynote-at-jquery-uk), a recap of the Internet's and World Wide Web's history. It was a nice reminder to have in thought throughout the conference.

After this, Veronika went to one of the side track talks: [Building a basic WYSIWYG editor](https://github.com/Kerry350/jQueryUKWorkshop2014).

> Did you know that building an editor isn't as hard as you might have thought? So if you don't fancy using rangy.js or just want to have a look under the hood of web editors, check out the tutorials we went through with [Kerry Gallagher](http://twitter.com/Kerry350) - it's fun!

Meanwhile, Chris and I stayed in the main room for an animated presentation by [Paul Lewis](https://twitter.com/aerotwist): [Build for the Future](https://speakerdeck.com/paullewis/build-for-the-future).

> Paul started by showing us some really useful tools for benchmarking and testing how optimised your website is (or isn't). [Network Link Conditioner](http://nshipster.com/network-link-conditioner/) was one tool for Mac users, which allows you to throttle your internet connection so it's unbearably slow.

> He also introduced us to Google's [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), a tool that allows you to test the speed of a given website and gives you some information about how to improve it. [Web Page Test](http://www.webpagetest.org/) is a similar tool, but with more emphasis on benchmarking.

> You can read up about the "best practices for modern web development" [here](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/).

After a short break, Veronika went to a workshop about 'automated testing of mobile apps using Appium.io' by [Jonathan Lipps](http://twitter.com/jlipps):

> Appium lets you test your compiled mobile applications by writing test code in a language of your choice. (Choose JavaScript, you know you want to!)
> Sadly it took me pretty much the whole workshop to set up the Android SDK on my machine so I didn't benefit from it too much. If you want to try out Appium, take a look at the [Appium homepage](http://appium.io/).

Back in the main track, [Lea Verou](http://twitter.com/LeaVerou) introduced us to  colourful things. She presented some interesting demos about [The Chroma Zone: Engineering Color on the Web](http://leaverou.github.io/chroma-zone) and showed us how useful CSS colour names can be:

[![Gray, dark gray](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BnwSZxsIUAACr2-.jpg:large)](https://twitter.com/tomsabin/status/467268696470482944)

The demos she showed us can be seen on her [GitHub](https://github.com/LeaVerou) account, but here are handful I think are definitely worth checking out:

- [Dabblet](http://dabblet.com/): an interactive CSS playground and code sharing tool.
- [Luminance != Lightness](http://leaverou.github.io/chroma-zone/#luminance-vs-lightness): enter a colour and see its luminance and lightness values.
- [Contrast Ratio](http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/): see the contrast ratio between text and background colours.

4) Last but not least, you learn cool new things like [developing apps with PhoneGap](/blog/first-steps-with-cordova-phonegap) and find out some more [tools to pack in your web developer toolbox](/blog/dev_toolboxpack).
