It seems there is a lot of talk about agile testing circulating, but is it really worth it? Agile testing is a mindset. We all know mindsets can be a challenge to change, and this is no different. But what are the benefits of moving to an agile testing approach?

**1. Save time and money**

Prevent bugs from appearing rather than being surprised by them at the end. Involve testers from the beginning of the process to prevent this.

**2. Have happier employees**

Engage employees by getting rid of error-prone and boring manual regression testing. Have your testers and developers pair to create automated regression tests.

**3. Delight the customer**

Exceed your customer’s expectations by making sure you aren’t just building what they asked for, but you’re building something that will add value for them.

**4. Improve your team’s velocity**

Increase momentum within your team by removing test bottlenecks and fixing defects immediately.

These are just some of the benefits which come with adopting the agile testing approach. [Click here](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/courses/agile-testing-course) to learn more about agile testing and see how it can benefit you and your team.
