We've rebooted our [Dev Newsletter](/blog?tags=Dev+Newsletter) to encompass links from the entire company.  You can expect plenty of tech as before but it'll be mixed in with our thoughts on design, agile, lean, and whatever else we find interesting each week.

## Failure Demand - [Murray](/people#murray-steele)

http://blog.mattedgar.com/2014/11/09/sink-or-swim-a-short-story-about-failure-demand/

A reminder that design is important to everything you do, no matter how trivial.  Start with the [user needs](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs.html) and work from there.

A company applies scrum and agile to their distributed management team.

>  The team was particularly struck with the fact that with the new levels of transparency and communication, even given their the different areas of expertise, it has become easy and normal for them to pick up parts of each otherâ€™s work regularly

## Waste in the NHS - [Martyn](/people#martyn-evans)

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/05/nhs-wastes-over-2-bn-on-unnecessary-treatment

SH:24 brought us into close contact with the NHS and the experience gave me a new perspective on the amount of waste within the different organisations. From software procurement to employee contracts, nothing quite works as well it should. There are some massive opportunities to make things better but a general sense that it's all too late.

## The new user story backlog is a map - Gavin

A flat backlog removes all context. Story Mapping is a backlog keeps the skeleton of the project in full view.

## The Phoenix Project - Dom

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phoenix_Project:_A_Novel_About_IT,_DevOps,_and_Helping_Your_Business_Win

I found this book fascinating and transformative in the same way as To Sell Is Human, Re:Work and The One Minute Manager Meets The Monkey.

## Communicate like Github - [Ben W](/people#ben-wong)

http://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/

How and why  to use chat and IM like github does.
