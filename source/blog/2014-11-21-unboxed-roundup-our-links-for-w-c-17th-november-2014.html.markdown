Dan McKinley of Etsy gives a very frank and honest presentation on the art of using data and common sense to prioritise web product features. Great insight.

## A statically-typed Ruby? - [Murray](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/murray-steele)

https://www.omniref.com/blog/blog/2014/11/17/matz-at-rubyconf-2014-will-ruby-3-dot-0-be-statically-typed/

In a write up of Ruby Kaigi that [we linked to previously](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/blog/ubxddev-vol-3-6) there was some mention of new features Matz was thinking about adding to Ruby 3.0.  This write up from RubyConf goes into more detail about a probably controversial feature that Matz has been mulling over: static types!  I'm really interested to see where this feature goes, and even if it doesn't make it in, what will it get us all thinking about that *does* make it in?
