<h2>Topics covered included:</h2>

* How to put the audience at ease<br/>
* How to encourage feedback<br/>
* Who to invite and what to<br/>
* Passive, continual and transparent communication<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Among the insights shared were:</h2>

* Get the Product Owner to run the Show and Tell - get them to cover what was delivered and what you plan to deliver next, actively encourage feedback<br/>
* Show the features you have delivered, those you planned and didn't deliver, and those you're doing next<br/>
* Rehearse your show and tell - create a story from the stories, make it quick and easy to understand<br/>
* Present journeys of upcoming stories so stakeholders can see what’s coming visually<br/>
* Looking for signs of success<br/>
* Watch the Product Owner’s language change from 'the product' to 'our product' - that's when there is ownership<br/>
* Get your same team fully committed to your project by committing to and delivering a retrospective every two weeks, without fail<br/>
</br>

<h2>Tips for the most successful two-weekly retrospectives included:</h2>

* Start retrospective with the [Retrospective Prime Directive](http://www.retrospectives.com/pages/retroPrimeDirective.html)<br/>
* Make it short, sharp and FULL of trust + collaboration<br/>
* Have passive communication mechanisms in the form of information radiators<br/>
* Task board<br/>
* Burn down for the sprint<br/>
* Burn up for the backlog<br/>
* Have your customer journey as wireframes and work in progress up on the walls - anyone who is interested can come and interact<br/>
