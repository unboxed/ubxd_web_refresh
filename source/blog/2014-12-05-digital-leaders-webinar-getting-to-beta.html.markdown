<h1>Topics covered included:</h1>

- Understanding Beta, knowing what you’re trying to achieve<br/>
- What you should be achieving in Alpha and Beta<br/>
- How to learn to see if it’s worth investing in this stage<br/>
- The activities covered Alpha and Beta<br/>
- The risk of this stage<br/>
- Using the feedback from your customers<br/>

<h1>Among the insights shared were:</h1>

- Alpha is about getting to the start of Beta, understanding all the things that will de-rail you<br/>
- What you want is a shared vision of what you’re building to be established and embedded within the team<br/>
- Once you’ve got real-life customers, you’re in a different level of risk<br/>
- Alpha is about <b>DE</b>fining your service, Beta is about <b>RE</b>fining it<br/>
- The important things to put in place for your Beta team: your technology, your larger team, your roadmap of the build, your onboard strategy for your service, metric gathering to put in place<br/>

<h1>Tips for successful Beta teams:</h1>

- Prepare the core elements and understand what you have to do in the Beta stage<br/>
- Establish the purpose and culture of your team<br/>
- Test the risk, make sure your users can get through and provide feedback<br/>
- Look at key metrics which influence your service<br/>
- Run real customers through your full service and then get feedback – talk to your customers, know them, know them better than they know themselves and know exactly how they use your service<br/>
