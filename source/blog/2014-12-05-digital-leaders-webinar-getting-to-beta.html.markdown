# Topics covered included:

* Understanding Beta, knowing what you’re trying to achieve
* What you should be achieving in Alpha and Beta
* How to learn to see if it’s worth investing in this stage
* The activities covered Alpha and Beta
* The risk of this stage
* Using the feedback from your customers

# Among the insights shared were:

* Alpha is about getting to the start of Beta, understanding all the things that will de-rail you
* What you want is a shared vision of what you’re building to be established and embedded within the team
* Once you’ve got real-life customers, you’re in a different level of risk
* Alpha is about <b>DE</b>fining your service, Beta is about <b>RE</b>fining it
* The important things to put in place for your Beta team: your technology, your larger team, your roadmap of the build, your onboard strategy for your service, metric gathering to put in place

# Tips for successful Beta teams:

* Prepare the core elements and understand what you have to do in the Beta stage
* Establish the purpose and culture of your team
* Test the risk, make sure your users can get through and provide feedback
* Look at key metrics which influence your service
* Run real customers through your full service and then get feedback – talk to your customers, know them, know them better than they know themselves and know exactly how they use your service
