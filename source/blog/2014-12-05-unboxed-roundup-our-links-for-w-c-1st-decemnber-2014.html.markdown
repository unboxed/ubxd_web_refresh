## Slow programming - [Murray](/people#murray-steele)

https://ventrellathing.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/the-case-for-slow-programming/

When I talk with developers in the early stages of their career one thing I try my hardest to let them know is that it's ok to take your time.  There's a mindset that productivity and speed are the most important things about being a programmer, and to be anything less than a "10x engineer" is a waste of your time.  I don't believe this narrative and I'm happy to see discussion of an alternative.  I particularly like that [Jeffrey](https://ventrellathing.wordpress.com/) describes his way of working as starting with a bunch of hacks and extracting good code from it once it is functionally complete; we don't have to write perfect code from the first keystroke.

I love data visualisations. I especially love these visualisations of London. A few examples being:

- a network map showing where people commute from
- a range of colours overlaid on London showing different ethnic groups
- Central Line vs average rent
