Welcome to 2015!  Here's what we've been thinking about over the festive period:

## Interviewing Scrum Masters - [Carlo](/people#carlo-kruger)

http://news.dice.com/2014/09/04/3-interview-questions-scrum-masters/

A nice article on what to ask Scrum Masters in an interview and why you should ask those questions.

## This. Is. Just. Crazy. - [Attila](/people/attila-gyorffy)

https://github.com/geelen/djgif

A DJ using Ableton Live, a huge bundle of MaxMSP emitting a UDP stream of beat information (courtesy of the immensely pro Cade), a UDP ➝ WebSockets server, and DJGif pulling hundreds of GIFs off various Tumblrs to beatmatch <x-gif> on two projectors makes for a hell of a good show.

A short article about why the "best places to work" often aren't. It's all down to creating a work environment that "enables and encourages all employees to regularly refuel and renew themselves, both on and off the job."

## The state of JavaScript in 2015 - [Tom S](/people#tom-sabin)

Jimmy Breck-McKye writes his opinions on the churn rate of JavaScript frameworks and technologies. It's worth reading the some of the comments on the article to see other's opinions too.
