<h2>Topics covered included:</h2>
• Roadmapping<br/>
• What not to do and how to untie your hands so you’re doing things as effectively and efficiently as possible<br/>
• Aligning your team – empowering them and removing the blockers<br/>
• Getting the code-base in a position to develop on, changing your pace and direction<br/>
• Getting this into production and hitting the big risks with this software<br/>
• The process of putting into development<br/>
<br/>

Among the insights shared were:<br/>

<h2>Get your teams structured in a more efficient way:</h2>
• Imagine your development team as being an efficient sausage machine, and your functional requirements that go into that machine are, as quickly as possible, being produced as sausages<br/>

• What not to do: throw more developers at a problem - it’s about communication, not speed of typing<br/>
• Your production pipeline is similar to the flow of traffic on a motorway – as you start adding cars to that motorway, the average speed starts dropping<br/>
• Reduce the amount the team is working on, get them to deliver a very small handful of things to start getting loosely delivering<br/>
• Look at all the meetings that your team are having – if they’re nothing to do with their current piece of work then either cancel or schedule for a day of the week that doesn’t disrupt the rest of the team<br/>
• If you’re going to have long-term planning sessions, time-box them and realise that there’s limited value in planning months and months ahead because things will change<br/>
