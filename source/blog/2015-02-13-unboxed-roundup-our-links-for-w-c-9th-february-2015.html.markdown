## git 2.3 released, with Push to Deploy - Gavin

https://github.com/blog/1957-git-2-3-has-been-released

A new version of git might not be that exciting, but 2.3 comes with **Push to Deploy**, where it will update a working copy after a push. Great for simple production server setups working via a checked-out git.

## Helpful Sublime package for Ruby tests - [Tom](/people#tom-sabin)

https://github.com/maltize/sublime-text-2-ruby-tests

There are a number of things this package adds to Sublime Text, but the most useful shortcut this adds for me is being able to press `Command + .` to switch between code and its respective test file.

## Mr Data Converter - [Chris](/people#chris-carter)

http://shancarter.github.io/mr-data-converter/

An awesome site for converting CSV/TSV/copy-paste from Excel/Numbers into a Ruby hash, JSON object, Python dictionary etc. A massive timesaver.

## Programmer Proverbs - Gavin

http://futurice.com/blog/programmer-proverbs

At the very least, they're food for discussion.

## The Dangerous Hero - [Carlo](/people#carlo-kruger)

http://semperagilis.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/champions-vs-heros.html

Back in 2009 I wrote [a blog post about the danger of hero-driven development](http://carlokruger.com/?p=35).  Jason Knight has made a great clarification about the differences between a hero and a champion.

## Track of the Week - [Neil](/people#neil-van-beinum)

I choose ['High Tea' by 'Roller Trio'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_IykuSDMng). It's dark. It's swirling. It's saxophone jazz-rock.
