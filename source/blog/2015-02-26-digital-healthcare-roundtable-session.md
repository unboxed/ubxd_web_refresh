Wednesday 18th February saw the Digital Healthcare Roundtable Session take place at Unboxed Consulting.


The session brought together a handpicked and diverse group of healthcare experts and leaders, with the aim to start a revolution in digital healthcare. Ideas were explored and exchanged about how we can do more to improve public health with digital technology, in this one-off discussion.

[Martyn Evans](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/martyn-evans) and [Carrie Bedingfield](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/carrie-bedingfield) both attended from Unboxed Consulting, with Carrie chairing the session.
