<h1>Topics covered included:</h1>

* The unspoken reasons developers can be excluded<br/>

* Security and privacy<br/>
* Integrating design within the design process<br/>
* Initial design meetings<br/>
* The role of a senior developer in a first meeting<br/>
<br/>

<h1>Amongst these topics, Andrew shared insights:</h1>

* Customers prefer to be spoken to honestly than be subject to hand waving<br/>
* You should include developers as they can provide insights that other participants can't<br/>
* Developers are some of the largest users of digital products and services so by including them you can gain access to a sophisticated user that may represent your target market<br/>
* Including developers can help make design part of the whole iterative process, where it can move from low to high fidelity as the development progresses<br/>
