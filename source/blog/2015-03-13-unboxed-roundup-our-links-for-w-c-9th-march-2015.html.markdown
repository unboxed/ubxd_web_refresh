## Sass Mixins vs Extends: The Data - Gavin

https://tech.bellycard.com/blog/sass-mixins-vs-extends-the-data/

If mixins and extends both have some amount of duplication, which is best?

## TDD in the games industry - [Murray](/people#murray-steele)

http://chrismdp.com/2015/03/why-games-coders-dont-use-tdd-and-why-it-matters/

[Chris Parsons](http://chrismdp.com/) writes here about the lack of TDD in the games industry.  This might sound anathema to us web developers, but what I found most interesting is the description of the things that the games industry does instead of TDD.  It's not hard to have 100% test coverage of an application that doesn't work, so it's clear that TDD is not the only solution to building production-ready software and it's worth exploring those alternatives once in a while.

## Why it's better to surf than have developers coding - Carlo

Only when everybody is moving fast can the system as a whole move faster. Local optimisations not only don't work, in software development they can actually create waste.

## Thanks to Service Workers push notifications is no longer only mobile device feature - [Paula](/people#paula-stepinska)

Great, detailed, ‘all you wanted to know and a bit more’ description of initialising and using push notification service in web applications.  For the time being available in Chrome and Android GCM.

## Design by Contract in Ruby - [Murray](/people#murray-steele)

http://awardwinningfjords.com/2015/03/03/my-weird-ruby.html

I like to see how code is written by different people.  Particularly when the code is very different to the code I might write myself.  The code that [Thomas Reynolds](http://awardwinningfjords.com/) shows off in this post is notable for two reasons:

1. He uses ``Struct`` to define his data classes and treats them mostly as dumb data stores, not adding much (if any) behaviour methods
2. He uses the [Contracts](http://egonschiele.github.io/contracts.ruby/) gem on the methods he does write to give ruby [design by contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract) capabilities

These techniques are quite different to the code I'd write day-to-day, and I'd be wary of introducing them in a client project where other developers have to pick it up later.  For better or worse as developers for a client-service agency we have to be fairly conservative in our development choices.  However, I can see how these techniques might be useful and I'd love to try them out on a side project to get a better feel for them before introducing them to our client work.

## Web app install banners on Chrome Beta - Gavin

Chrome on mobile is developing a standard for displaying a banner prompting the user to add your Web App to their homescreen. UX Standardization!
