As we celebrate our 10th birthday next week, we thought we'd look back at what song was riding high as UK #1 on 29th April 2005. Much to our surprise, it was Peter Kay singing <i>‘Is This The Way To Amarillo?’</i> along with Tony Christie, wearing a purple suit and a jazzy shirt to go with it (are you sure this isn't you in the video, [Richard](/people#richard-stobart)?):<br/>

I thought it would make for some good nostalgia to look back at what the UK #1 song was on the birthday of 10 Unboxed people, then get a few words from them on their <i>“anniversary”</i> song.<br/>

So we start the countdown...<br/>
<br/>
##10. [Sarah](/people#sarah-beck):<br/>
<h1>Sonia - You'll Never Stop Me Loving You</h1>
<iframe width="700" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xUmFD8_0q9U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
Sarah's comment:<i>“I hadn't heard this until I had to search for it! I wish it has been something better, 1989 had some crackers.”</i><br/>
<br/>

##9. [Claire](/people#claire-kemp):<br/>
<h1>Bee Gees - Stayin' Alive</h1>
<iframe width="700" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_izvAbhExY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
Claire's comment: <i>“This is the beat for CPR repetition. I had a 70's party for my 21st, we played it. I also still like to listen to it but not too often!"</i><br/>
<br/>

##8. Shirin:<br/>
<h1>Mariah Carey - Without You</h1>
<iframe width="700" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hat1Hc9SNwE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
Shirin's comment: <i>“On a serious note, you can't live without food.”</i><br/>
<br/>

##7. [Chris](/people#chris-carter):<br/>
<h1>Bombalurina - Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini</h1>
<iframe width="700" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MR98gRckjmY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
Chris' comment: <i>“God, this is embarrassing.”</i><br/>
<br/>

##6. Tyler:<br/>
<h1>Bryan Adams - (Everything I Do) I Do It for You</h1>
<iframe width="700" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zggSgIT0yd0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
Tyler's comment: <i>"'Don’t tell me it’s not worth fighting for.' Wise words, Bryan Adams. This song has two guitar solos in it. How rad is that? (Shortcuts - 2:43 onwards & 4:50)".</i><br/>
<br/>

##5. [Tom S](/people#tom-sabin):<br/>
<h1>Wet Wet Wet - Goodnight Girl</h1>
<iframe width="700" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VI_MBT0GQrQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
Tom's comment: <i>"I have no recollection of this, nice haircut though.”</i><br/>
<br/>

##4. [Neil](/people#neil-van-beinum):<br/>
<h1>Foreigner - I Want To Know What Love Is</h1>
<iframe width="700" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/raNGeq3_DtM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
Neil's comment: <i>"I definitely know the song, can't say I have any particular attachment to it"</i><br/>
<br/>

##3. [Graeme](/people#graeme-mccubbin):<br/>
<h1>Marc Almond & Gene Pitney - Something's Gotten Hold Of My Heart</h1>
<iframe width="700" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZTX0RBlqnM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
Graeme's comment: <i>"This song gives me the creeps... Given the choice, I'd definitely go for the US #1 on my birthday, [Paula Abdul - Straight Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El1kgCqD7Xk). (Would probably choose Paula Abdul in most situation)."</i><br/>
<br/>

##2. [Carrie](/people#carrie-bedingfield):<br/>
<h1>The Boomtown Rats - I Don't Like Mondays</h1>
<iframe width="700" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Kobdb37Cwc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>):<br/>
Carrie's comment: <i>"It's not true that I don't like Mondays. But I <b>do</b> like rats and I think they should have more weekday opportunities for fun and dancing. So in that way it is an entirely accurate predictor of my personality and world view."</i><br/>
<br/>

And we've hit the last song in the countdown...<br/>
<br/>

##1. [Richard](/people#richard-stobart):<br/>
<h1>Jane Birkin et Serge Gainsbourg - Je T'aime,...Moi Non Plus</h1>
<iframe width="700" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3Fa4lOQfbA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
Richard's comment: <i>"Classy."</i><br/>
