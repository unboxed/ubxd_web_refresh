* 10 attendees ([see who attended](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2NhOcmmEbFZWi1odC1fVURBMXc/view?usp=sharing))
* 3 lightning talks
* 4 discussions

Wednesday 20th May saw us pull up a chair to our first media roundtable discussion session.

From publishers to TV and from music to education, traditional media companies have changed beyond recognition in the last decade in the shift to digital. Disaggregation of formats, new customer behaviours, new business models:

* How do the best established media companies manage a complex portfolio of new digital products and services?
* How do you create new business models fast when old ones are falling away?
* How can digital deliver agile into a waterfall organisation?

These are just some of the questions this session aimed to answer…

Joined by heads of industry and thought-leaders in the media sector, the session was to learn from each other and find better ways to lead the digital transformation of the media company we work for.

## Lightning talk 2: 'The onion and the orange'
<h1>Richard Stobart, CEO - Unboxed Consulting</h1>

The second lightning talk came from our very own CEO. Richard compared the old way of building systems (‘oranges’) with the new way (‘onions’): <i>“As we build up the layers, it comes more like an onion”</i>. Also explored was:

* Time versus ignorance
* Addressing the highest risks first
* Lining up a project in terms of value
