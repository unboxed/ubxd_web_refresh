## Don’t use `before_action` to load data - [Tom S](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/tom-sabin)

* http://craftingruby.com/posts/2015/05/31/dont-use-before-action-to-load-data.html

> I follow this pattern for most Rails apps, however after reading this short opinion article, I totally agree and have started to follow his alternative instead. Short summary is, yes, loading data in before actions keeps the controller DRY, but perhaps too DRY. The alternative is to explicitly set the instance variables for each action - it will read much clearer.

## Take control of your mail with Mailbox - [Tom S](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/tom-sabin)

* http://www.mailboxapp.com

> Mailbox (by Dropbox) for iOS has been around for a little bit of time already, however I’ve only just found out that there is a beta Mac app as well. I finally feel in control of my numerous email accounts after failing miserably to use Mac’s native mail app smart mailboxes (which is simply fully of bugs). Organise important emails that you want to save into lists, otherwise archive them and try and get your badge count down to 0!
