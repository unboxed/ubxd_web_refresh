## Monolith vs Microservice First? - [Patrick V](/people#patrick-vine)

* http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html
* http://samnewman.io/blog/2015/04/07/microservices-for-greenfield/

Microservices are the cool kid on the block, but they come with different complexity to a monolithic architecture. Both of these links discuss the trade offs at a highlevel - and in the case of Sam Newman in a particular example - of whether to start with a monolith or a microservice architecture.  Sneak preview: Perhaps a small monolith is a good place to start on a greenfield project.

## Consumer psychology made easy - [Willa R](/people#willa-roos)

[Cognitive Lode](http://coglode.com/) breaks behavioural economics and consumer psychology down into fun, shiny, and easy to understand nuggets

## Finally, a date and time picker that doesn't suck - [Tom S](/people#tom-sabin)

* http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/date/
* http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/time/

I have been searching far and wide for decent date and time picker and finally decided on Amsul’s [pickadate.js](https://github.com/amsul/pickadate.js). It offers plenty of style customisation and configuration and so far I can’t fault it.

## Inject and the healthy kind of headache - [Pedro M](/people/pedro-moreirea)

https://robots.thoughtbot.com/derive-inject-for-a-better-understanding

I have found myself return to this blog post lately trying to solve a couple of problems. It gives the kind of headache I like: the one caused by learning. It is approaches the concept of monoids and their use in composition.

## DateTime vs Time - [Chris C](/people#chris-carter)

https://gist.github.com/pixeltrix/e2298822dd89d854444b

Our very own [Andrew W](/people#andrew-white) helpfully explains the misconceptions about the Ruby [DateTime](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/date/rdoc/DateTime.html) and [Time](http://ruby-doc.org/core/Time.html) objects, and when to use each one.  An explanation so helpful it was [added to the official ruby docs](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/4545875)!

## Mind bending design fiction from an alternative universe - [Dom M](/people/dominic-mason)
