I was having a conversation with one of our Agile coaches, who has a long history of project management delivery. We were discussing:<br/>

> <i>Who owns the successful delivery of value of the features in a traditional project approach?</i>
<br/>

I think the answer is:<br/>

> It falls between the gaps.

<br/>
In a [PRINCE2](https://www.prince2.com) world, you have:<br/>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/unboxed-web-image-uploader/e87659b5-99a4-40ae-acf7-5a7ce0dd6af7.png" alt="PRINCE2"></p>

<h2>1. An IT project manager</h2>
They generally deliver the solution.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>2. A business project manager</h2>
They deliver the business components required to support the solution, re-structure the business process, get everyone set up to start using the solution and make sure the training is in place.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>3. A steering group</h2>
This group is there to pull the strings and make sure that the project is delivering against the business case.<br/>
<br/>

However, all these things fall apart at the end of a project. You do your <i>‘ta-da!’</i> release that delivers everything, everyone congratulates each other on a slightly late but effective delivery of the project, and then they go back to their day jobs.<br/>

No one owns the delivery of the business case, which is why the project was initially justified.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>The solution</h2>

Choose a Product Owner.<br/>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/unboxed-web-image-uploader/9e6c362b-a65c-435c-8ef4-9cd2befbeacf.png" alt="Product Owner"></p>

Give them the budget to deliver what they need to deliver to make the business case work.<br/>

They might not be interested in delivering the lower value / higher cost features that were originally in the scoping document. They’re interested in delivering, as soon as possible, the one or two high value features that:<br/>

* De-risk the project
* Start generating revenue
* Validate that customers want it
* Start getting some traction in the business and market

Only once they get that traction will they then be willing to invest more to deliver the next set of features.<br/>

More importantly, they will learn what the next most-valuable set of features are, only once the first set of features are actually seen working in production (or <i>not</i> working in production).<br/>

Make sure your project is set up with a Product Owner (or a business project manager) that is solely dedicated to making sure that the benefits are <i>delivered</i>. The benefits are easier to deliver if you have a lower cost overhead for them. So if the person is empowered to make decisions on which benefits can be delivered for which spend, then they will naturally deliver <b>only</b> the highest value / lowest cost items.<br/>

It’s important to view your project as a set of features, some of which are:<br/>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/unboxed-web-image-uploader/88d95eec-f29f-4f8d-8c14-c4804528abc8.png" alt="Value and cost"></p>

It’s also important to understand the return on your investment for each feature. You don't want to deliver the features that are going to cost you a lot and not deliver any value.<br/>

The value is delivered in terms of either:

* Cash in the bank from revenue generated
* De-risking internally or externally
* De-risking the technical solution

So assess the value but, more importantly, empower someone to deliver on that value and look at outcomes, <b>not</b> scope.
