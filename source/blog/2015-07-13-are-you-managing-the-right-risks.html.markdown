title: "Are you managing the right risks?"

I was talking to a very good Project Manager the other day. We were talking about the risks that a Project Manager manages in the delivery of software.<br/>

In a traditional project, the risks <b>managed</b> are often not actually the <b>biggest</b> risks that project will have. Some possible risks that the project will have are:<br/>

* The thing you’re building will not be used to generate the benefit you think it will deliver (this is the <b>biggest</b> risk)
* What you’re building will not be liked by customers – it won’t solve their problems
* They’ll find something better or something that is available sooner but is not-as-good, which they’ll start using and be reluctant to switch from this to your product
* The thing that you deliver will have obvious <i>‘gotcha’</i>s: once you see it working, you’ll realise it would never have worked the way you’d envisioned
* People use it in a way that you would never have imagined and you have to change all your future features based on how people are actually using it

<h2>Technical risks</h2>

The other sorts of risks the project will have are technical risks:<br/>

* It will never scale
* The development team you have in place aren’t capable of delivering a solution
* The amount they quoted to do this is nowhere <b>near</b> enough to deliver it
* The software you’re using is not fit for purpose
* The production environment won’t be ready in time

And how about...<br/>

* The various components you’ve been building don’t integrate well together – one development team has misunderstood how the interface to the other development team’s work will work. One team is sending apples and the other team is expecting oranges.
* The amount of things you have to prepare in I&O (Infrastructure & Operations), security or pre-production are so numerous and you didn’t realise you had so many hurdles to jump over before you could put this into production.
* The requirements you’ve received have now gone out-of-date and are stale. You had a team working on the requirements, they haven’t synched and some requirements documents have been moved forward after review and others haven’t. The whole thing doesn’t string together, end-to-end.
* What you thought was absolutely critical, when you were writing the requirements document, turns out to be irrelevant in the new world.

<h2>An Agile approach</h2>

These are the sorts of risks that an Agile approach highlights early on. Agile gets a bad reputation for pointing out that there are all these risks. People don’t like seeing a lot of risk. They prefer to do something in a more <i>“risk-free”</i> environment where things are steadier and planned further.<br/>

All we’re really doing is pushing the risks that we know exist under the carpet and revisiting them later.<br/>

Agile means we see the risks that are already there (whether we choose to look directly at them or not), understand them and change tack quickly before the risk becomes a product-halting problem.
