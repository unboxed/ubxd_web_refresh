## Track of the Week - [Warren](https://twitter.com/WarrenKHall)

My track of the week is "Versions" By "Moderat"

_Moderat is an electronic music project that originated in Berlin, Germany. It started as a collaboration between [Sascha Ring](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Apparat_(musician)), also known as [Apparat](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Apparat_(musician)), and [Modeselektor](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Modeselektor) members, Gernot Bronsert and Sebastian Szary._

Being a long time fan of deep, moody and experimental electronic music, It came as no surprise that I fell in love with this group the instant I heard them.
They pretty much broke through with their self-titled album "Moderat" Which includes this track and "Bad Kingdom". Give them a listen as they are pretty amazing!

I've included a fan made music video for the track using visual shots from the movie "Moon", Enjoy :)
