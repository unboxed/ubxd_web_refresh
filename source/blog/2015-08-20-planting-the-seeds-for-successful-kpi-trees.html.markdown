KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and KPI trees were at the root of Wednesday’s Masterclass, hosted by [Richard Stobart](/people#richard-stobart).<br/>

A blend of senior digital stakeholders, product owners and digital creatives attended this one-off session to explore the answers to burning questions:<br/>

* What is the methodology for creating new <i>‘greenfield’</i> Key Performance Indicator improvements?
* How do you step up a level to the strategic product view?
* What drives your metrics?
* How do you use <i>‘smart KPI branching’</i> to discover how users really behave?
<br/>

<h1>Introduction - Get into pairs and draw 'how does electricity work?'</h1>
To get the attendees' in creative thinking mode and talking to one another, the morning began with an introduction exercise, mapping out a diagram of how attendees think electricity works.<br/>

Armed with a partner, a large piece of paper, a Sharpie marker each and some 'interesting' concepts around electricity generation, the creative sparks began to fly:<br/>

And the finished posters were shared on the walls:<br/>

## Session 1: Introducing KPIs
Richard kicked off the morning’s first session - defining what a KPI is and how they can benefit your organisation:<br/>

<br/>
The topic then branched into KPI trees:<br/>
<br/>

<h1>What is a KPI tree?</h1>
>
<i>‘A KPI Tree is a graphical method of managing KPIs.’</i>

<br/>
An example KPI tree was shared:<br/>

* <b>Strategic Goal:</b> What you’re aiming to achieve
* <b>Theme:</b> Dimensions of all the elements that you’re going to be measuring
* <b>Tactic:</b> How you will achieve these themes; the small steps you’re going to take
* <b>Measure:</b> How you’ll measure these tactics
<br/>
<br/>

<h1>Why should you build a KPI tree for your organisation?:</h1>

* 'Management' or 'the business' speaks the language of KPIs, PIs and measurable/auditable value
* 'Development' or 'innovation' speaks the language of delivering digital features, managing teams and technology
* Building KPI trees helps 'Management' build a structured method by which to speak to 'Development'
* Having a KPI tree helps development and innovation make development decisions make a significant difference on strategic PIs and KPIs
* They are simple visual tools which can sum up large strategic initiatives in a few key indicator
<br/>
<br/>

<h1>What are the benefits of KPI trees?:</h1>

* Sum up a complex situation
* Help build agreement
* Easy to explain the approach
* Keep in step with changes in strategy
* Understand how measures interact
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<h1>Pre-requisites for setting your KPIs:</h1>

* Have a clear strategy and objectives
* Make sure you have a pre-defined process for implementing this system
* Set clear business objectives for the process
* Have both quantitative and qualitative measurements
* Have an active approach to finding and remedying enterprise variances
<br/>
<br/>

<h1>Other insights:</h1>

* Start at the top, have a business objective or strategy you’re trying to achieve then have a set of measures around that to help you achieve
* The KPI is not the <i>“thing”</i>, it’s just an indication of what the <i>“thing”</i> might be
* If you’re a slave to the metric, you could be watching the wrong thing

<h1>When building your KPI tree, think about your themes:</h1>

* Themes are dimensions of all the elements that you’re going to start measuring
* Think about the things you’re going to measure and group them into themes
* From themes come your measures, which are your KPIs
<br/>
<br/>


## Session 2: Test and create your plan

* What should you be measuring that you’re not measuring?
* How are you sure that you’re moving towards your vision?
* Is there a measure you can look at that will give you an indication that what you’re doing is moving you towards your strategic goal?
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<h1>Tips on creating your KPI trees:</h1>

* Keep it human – make your strategy something that everyone can understand and work towards
* Publicise and radiate – share your KPIs with your team
* Act on your KPIs – is it telling you something is going wrong?
* Don't rely on measures - think about what they are actually telling you
* Keep it fresh
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

With the seeds of each attendee's KPI tree planted, the session was complete, giving the opportunity to take their trees back to their organisation to water, nurture and grow.<br/>
<br/>

Reflecting on the session, some of the insights and actions taken away included:<br/>

>
<i>"I need to set some targets for my measures, instead of measuring for the sake of measuring"</i>

>
<i>"Reviewing my customer’s metrics to see if I can align them closer to the real goal is important"</i>

>
<i>"I want to set up some sales funnels using Google Analytics"</i>

>
<i>"I need to check that I’m gathering the right metrics"</i>
