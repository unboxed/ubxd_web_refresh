## `Math.random()` in V8 isn't as random as you think - [Andrew W](/people#andrew-white)

https://medium.com/@betable/tifu-by-using-math-random-f1c308c4fd9d#.yowj1q70f

Mike Malone, CTO of Betable, describes how collisions in request ids generated by using Math.random() in Node.js lead to the worrying discovery that it's PRNG is not as good as it should be.

Thereâ€™s a nice image that demonstrates the problem:

## Ruby 2.3 - what's new? - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

* https://blog.blockscore.com/new-features-in-ruby-2-3/
* http://dev.mensfeld.pl/2015/11/ruby-2-3-0-changes-and-features/

Ruby 2.3 is just around the corner so it's time to start exploring what new features it'll have.  These articles cover the changes that are coming and give some pointers as to why we might want to use them.  I haven't found any guides about performance in Ruby 2.3, but I expect the general trend to be slightly upwards if the graphs on [is ruby fast yet](http://www.isrubyfastyet.com/) are any indication.

["It's My Party" - Lesley Gore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acRMALrg1t4&feature=youtu.be)

Whilst "networking" at Agile on the Beach earlier this year, Claire and I invented a game whereby if you met someone new, you had to introduce them to your colleagues (Gram, Jack and Ben were also along) by singing a song with their name in the title. We tried it on many people and the best one we came up with to introduce me was "It's my Marty and I'll cry if I want to". I never knew who sang the original but it turns out it was a young Lesley Gore, produced by the mighty Quincy Jones. It's quite something!
