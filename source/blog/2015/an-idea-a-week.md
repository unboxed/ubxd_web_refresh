# It is not all about thinking

Knowledge Workers are defined as those who "think for a living". That is their actual job ... thinking about better ways to solve problems. We have plenty of them at Unboxed Consulting, having thoughts that are defining the future of work.

One quandary in our people working on our clients' problems all day is finding the time to have new ideas that are completely unrelated to our clients' projects. We know that they do not stop thinking at the end of the day and that they may still be trying to solve the problems they have come across as they eat their dinner or bath their kids. 

In this new world where businesses dependency on technology is increasing <b>knowledge and ideas are the new currency</b>. It is in our best interest to create environments in which ideas can flow, which is what we are trying to do with Linkers and Thinkers, an idea we had one week...

To stimulate conversations, we have randomly paired people to have lunch and bounce ideas. Each person in the organisation is paired twice over a certain period. In each pair their is a person playing the role of the "Thinker" whilst the other is the "Linker". Thinkers are invited to bring thoughts about new technology, something that is troubling them or an idea that they may have had whilst doing a random task. Linkers set up a time and place to meet the Thinker and have an opinion on the Thinker's thoughts. We have added food to the mix for fuelling conversation which the Linker pays for and expenses - as per our company agreement that expenses under £100 are preauthorised.

It is not imperative that each session results in a good idea. Having an opportunity to think about stuff is the real benefit we are trying to maximise because new ideas inspire others and spark more new ideas. In the very least, these are opportunities to establish greater relationships between people who work for the same organisation but possibly do not see each other on a day to day basis. Our people will probably find common ground in discussing emerging technology and issues that may be worth trying to solve. We have a virtual ideas board where thoughts worth more conversation are captured and plan to filter these into the organisation. 

Which brings us to the nitty gritty... There is a statutory presumption in the United Kingdom that intellectual property (IP) created by an employee during the course of his or her employment is generally owned by the employer. We recently embarked on a mission to revise the IP clause in our contract to differentiate between ideas that emerge as part of people's work at Unboxed Consulting and ideas that people have and explore independently of work. Our motivation for this is that people feel ownership of their own ideas and might feel unwilling or unable to progress or share them if the company is likely to claim ownership at some point. We are keen that more of these ideas emerge as possible opportunities to work on together.

Our people get 10 innovation days a year that are for booking time out from project work. To bolster our innovation strategy and encourage generation and sharing of new ideas we are trial allowing our innovation days to be used to work on people's own ideas. So, if our people aren’t on project work or taking part in some other structured activity, they can use that time to do what they think is valuable.

In order to share what is happening, we have various channels for communicating movement on ideas. There is a monthly rota for Linking and Thinking, a trello board and slack channel. We've also added an Ideas section to Whines and Cheers (our weekly company wide retrospective) and send updates out in our weekly newsletter.

Our team on the bench have daily stand ups to discuss new ideas. This week we are doing a brain dump and tomorrow we hope to plan our collaboration to build an MVP.
