## The Website Obesity Crisis - [Andrew W](/people#andrew-white)

http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm

With the increasing use of Mobile Web all of the extra bells and whistles that
get added to web pages literally cost you money. Maciej Cegłowski, founder of
Pinboard, dissects problem and discovers that even the programs from the likes
of Google and Facebook designed to address the problem can't avoid falling into
the same traps.

## Naming is a process ⇒ insights into such a process - [Patrick V](/people#patrick-vine)

I find it useful to understand the processes that people go through to acheive
the code they write.  This is an extensive dig into the process of naming
things and is an interesting read (though long).  Being deliberate about the
things we do is valuable so hopefully this will help generate conversations
about how to get to good names in software.

## Images as a Service - [Anson K](/people#anson-kelly)

By Andy Croll of Brighton Ruby fame

The average web page size is greater than 2MB, and increasing. And great
swathes of that are images. Serving the right size of image can vastly improve
the experience for your users. But while we're arguing about whether Rails is
slow or not we're chucking vast images at peoples phones over EDGE connections.

Serving images should be a 'solved' problem, just like it is for 'hosting' or
authentication. However lots of solutions make poor default suggestions. What
can we do for our users with 100 lines of code, Sinatra, a single gem and a CDN?
