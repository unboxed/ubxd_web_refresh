## Deadlock empire! - [Murray S](/team#murray-steele)

https://deadlockempire.github.io/

An in-browser game that teaches you about the pitfalls of thread programming.  You play the part of a scheduling wizard defending a realm against attack by the parralel wizard.  Your only form of defense is to run the enemey code in such a sequence as to cause deadlock or thread exceptions.  It's fun, fairly short, and a good exploration of how hard it is to write correct thread-safe code even with all the mutexes, queues, semaphores, and condition variables at your disposal.

## Continues delivery standards and what's no longer good enough - [Paula S](/team#paula-stepinska)

https://gojko.net/2016/02/01/potentially-shippable/

Thoughtful article about changes in software delivery and how 'potentially shippable' should be a minimum to reach and not the aim we look for at the end of each iteration.

## `puts` debugging - [Murray S](/team#murray-steele)

http://tenderlovemaking.com/2016/02/05/i-am-a-puts-debuggerer.html

This article from [Aaron Patterson](https://twitter.com/tenderlove) shows us some of the techniques he uses to debug software.  Mostly it's a bunch of `puts` statements in the right places to track down where and why something is happening.  He also describes it as an iterative process; drop in a `puts` where you think the problem is and then start digging from there.  A great reminder that debugging is hard even for seasoned developers who are very familiar with a project.  You don't need to be scared about modifying library code, and you don't need to learn complex debugging tools; you just need to dive in with some `puts` statements and let the code lead you to the problem.
