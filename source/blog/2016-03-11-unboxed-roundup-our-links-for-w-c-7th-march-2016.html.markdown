http://blog.agilistic.nl/8-useful-strategies-for-splitting-large-user-stories-and-a-cheatsheet/

If you’re struggling to break large user stories down, this article has a few different perspectives to think of, which may help you.


## Market Rights? - Claire K

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Current <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ruby?src=hash">#Ruby</a> Permanent Salaries in London. Pls share, pls no steal. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LRUG?src=hash">#LRUG</a> <a href="https://t.co/tfIfLPrU0B">pic.twitter.com/tfIfLPrU0B</a></p>&mdash; LøuisЯøЯ LouisRoR (@LouisRoR) <a href="https://twitter.com/LouisRoR/status/706894498970902530">March 7, 2016</a></blockquote>
