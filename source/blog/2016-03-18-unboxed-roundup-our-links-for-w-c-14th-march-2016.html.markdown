I [have form](https://twitter.com/hlame/status/389678115519483904) when it comes to disliking programming with time and calendars, so it should come as no surprise that I enjoyed this article about how messy our calendaring systems really are.

## An alternative to Rails? - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://rossta.net/blog/what-i-learned-about-hanami.html

[Ross Kaffenberger](https://twitter.com/rossta) has been exploring [Hanami](http://hanamirb.org/) and has taken the time to write up his experiences.  Since hearing [Luca Guidi](https://lucaguidi.com/) speak about Hanami (then lotus.rb) at [Brighton Ruby](https://speakerdeck.com/jodosha/lotus-brighton-ruby-2015) in 2015 it's been an itch at the back of my mind to explore it some more.  Ross' article only makes that itch stronger.  Even if I do and decide that I'm happy with Rails, it doesn't hurt to explore alternatives and see how they compare and what their differences can teach me.
