## Removing social buttons - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://ia.net/know-how/sweep-the-sleaze

I'm sure we've added a plethora of sharing buttons to sites over the years to allow users to share the page with their network.  Word-of-mouth advertising is assumed to be better and sharing buttons feel like a good way to remind people to tell their networks about something.  This article from [iA](https://ia.net) proposes dropping the buttons entirely; if people want to share something they'll do it anyway without the buttons, and if they don't the buttons won't make them.  It's an interesting idea backed up by some data.  Doesn't hurt that removing those buttons will also speed up page load and rendering.  Also worth reading is their [follow up](https://ia.net/know-how/sweep-the-sleaze-reactions) that shares some responses from around the web to the original.
