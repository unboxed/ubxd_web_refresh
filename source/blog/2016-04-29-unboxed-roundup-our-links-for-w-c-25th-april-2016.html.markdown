## Changing the world for the better - [Matt T](/people#matt-turrell)

http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html

Thanks to Tom Sabin a fellow Unboxeder, I’ve been reading fantastic series of posts about Elon Musk, Tesla and Space X over the last few days.

The second part of the post, about energy, the environment and the car industry was particularly enlightening.

It’s left me with a strange combination of bleakness and hope about the state of the environment.

I thoroughly recommend investing the time in reading the series.

## Advice from 40 year old me to 30 year old me - [Matt T](/people#matt-turrell)

http://matadornetwork.com/life/advice-40-year-old-30-year-old/

It’s interesting how your perspective changes over time. This post appeared in my Facebook feed yesterday and contains some real words of wisdom. I’m glad to have arrived at pretty much this point myself (well, I’m still working on a bit of it).

I wonder if, when I was 30, I would’ve listened to the advice or something you just grow into. I suspect the latter.

Worth a read.

## Decoupling database migrations from application deployments - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

http://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/post/2014/05/06/database-migrations-done-right/

A recent discussion with some colleagues about deployments and whether or not to run database migrations by default made me realise that I'd internalised the "fact" that automatically running migrations as part of a deploy was bad, but I couldn't recall any of the arguments for why.  This article gave me a good refresher on those arguments, and even better I find that I still agree with them.  I just hope I remember them this time.

## Track of the Week - Cale T

It's been over three years since James Blake released his sophomore album Overgrown (which went on to win the 2013 Mercury Prize), and since then he's experimented with a number of smaller projects under his newly formed label 1-800 Dinosaur. Earlier this year, James Blake released 'Modern Soul' - the first hint that a new album was imminent. Other songs have dropped since (including a collaboration with Beyonce on Lemonade), but none have been able to match the ghostly, minimalist atmosphere created by 'Modern Soul'.
