## Redesigning the UX of employment to deliver value in short employee lifespans - [Claire K](/people#claire-kemp)

http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/knot-resources-11067260296

It is generally accepted as standard that people aren't sticking in their jobs very long. Couple that with a really _tiny_ pool of talent to fish from and you start to realise how ridiculously hard it is for companies to attract and retain talent to build sustainable businesses.

Over the last couple of years we have developed tools for new joiner onboarding and employee engagement that deliver optimal value during shortened employee lifespans. This series of webinars has been set up to share what we have learnt.

## What to expect in Ruby 2.4 - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://blog.blockscore.com/new-features-in-ruby-2-4

There's nothing groundbreaking coming in ruby 2.4, but then I don't think we should expect that from a minor point release.  It looks like it's mostly incremental API improvements.  The `Regexp#match?` seems silly on the face of it; why not stop exposing the `$~` global from the existing methods?  That'd be a breaking change though so giving us a new method instead of changing the behaviour of all the existing ones is a sensible thing to do.  More developers should be this careful with their libraries and APIs.
