A short, but interesting, Ruby Whodunit.

## Being targetted because of your github profile - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

http://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/on-cybersecurity-and-being-targeted

[Kenneth Reitz](http://www.kennethreitz.org/) describes a fairly sophisticated phishing attempt he was tagetted by because of his access to open source projects on github.  Another timely reminder to enable 2FA on your accounts, and be wary about logging in to links you get via email or sms.

## Track of the Week - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

Fuzzy guitars, shouty choruses, horror-film videos.  What's not to love?  Really excited for their new album in November.
