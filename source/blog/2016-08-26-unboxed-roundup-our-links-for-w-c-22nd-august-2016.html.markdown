## "fs" unpublished and restored - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

http://status.npmjs.org/incidents/dw8cr1lwxkcr

In responding to a flagged package, npm Inc. broke project builds that had mistakenly required the bogus "fs" package rather than requiring the "fs" module from Node.

## Track of the Week - [Claire K](/people#claire-kemp)

This song throws me straight back into the teeth-gnashing and breast-beating melodrama that being a teenager encompasses. I loved it during a wonderfully wicked time of independence and fear, excitement and heartbreak. More recently applicable to my experience of childminders... *let down and hanging around* [with children], [ambitions of coming in to Blossom street to do adult talk] *crushed like a bug on the ground*. Bittersweet. Enjoy.
