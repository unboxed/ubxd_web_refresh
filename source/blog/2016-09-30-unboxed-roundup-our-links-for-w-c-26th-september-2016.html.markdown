## Thoughts on code review - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

http://blog.davidablack.net/2016/09/27/some-thoughts-on-code-review/

Github recently released some [new features for doing code-review in
pull-requests](https://github.com/blog/2256-a-whole-new-github-universe-announcing-new-tools-forums-and-features#code-better-with-reviews)
so it's a good time to have a think about what code-review really is,
and how we should go about doing it.  I really like the things that [David A.
Black](http://www.davidablack.net/) says in this timely article.  He
suggests that reivew is about checking for unclear code, not nitpicking
that it's not exactly the code you would have written.

## Track of the Week - [Carlo K](/people#carlo-kruger)

Something a little different. Carl Cox's iconic Ibiza club night Space is closed after 15 years. This is his 8 hour closing set presented in two parts. Part one has a more retro feel as he tries to summarize 15 years of dance music including classics like "The Bells" by Jeff Mills.
