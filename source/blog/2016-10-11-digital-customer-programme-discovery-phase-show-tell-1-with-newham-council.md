I spent Wednesday morning visiting the Digital Team at Newham Council, to attend the first Show & Tell of their [10-week Digital Customer Programme Discovery Phase](https://unboxed.co/news/unboxed-is-awarded-digital-customer-programme-discovery-phase-contract-with-newham-council/).<br/>

Over the last week, a small Unboxed team have been working alongside the Digital Team at Newham Council to take the first steps in transforming how they deliver their key services to 325,000 local residents, as well as making these services increasingly efficient for the council, through taking an innovative approach.<br/>

These Show & Tell sessions are open to anyone and everyone who would like to come along, including key stakeholders, eager colleagues and those just looking to see what the team are up to. The aim of this 20-minute session is to have a transparent platform for the team to share their progress from the previous one-week sprint, address what they plan on tackling in the following sprint, and answer any questions or queries attendees may have.<br/>

In the final part of the Show & Tell, the team shared the activities they aim to cover across Sprint Two:<br/>

- Visiting libraries, services centres, housing centres and customer contact centres to carry out further interview with local residents
- Beginning to create and build up user personas
- Mapping the current resident user journey for the Housing service to visualise how users flow through the journey, from entry to exit

With the Show & Tell wrapped up in exactly 20 minutes, the team sat together to debrief, sharing how each person thought the session went and discuss the plan of action for the afternoon, focussing mostly around user interview activities with local residents:<br/>

- How to approach these residents
- What sort of questions to ask
- What themes to capture from these interviews

Sprint One: Done! Itâ€™s now time for the team to head into the second sprint of this Digital Customer Programme Discovery Phase.
