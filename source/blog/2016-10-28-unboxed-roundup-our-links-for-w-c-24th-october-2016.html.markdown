how the web works.

a trip to GDS by their Service Development Director.

## Track of the Week - [Bergen L](/people#bergen-larsen)

Following on from Gary's inspiration of old school punk rock, it is a song from my youth which seems appropriate considering the fact that I'm mid-way through exam season and my brain feels like stew.
