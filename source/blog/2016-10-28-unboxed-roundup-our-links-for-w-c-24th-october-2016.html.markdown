## Static typing will not save us from broken software - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

http://www.drmaciver.com/2016/10/static-typing-will-not-save-us-from-broken-software/

I think this is an interesting topic. This is a writeup of the tradeoffs of
static typing & automated testing. I think one key point is that it's often
easier to cover a bug that made it into the wild with a test than model it
in a type system. There's also a good discussion over on [Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12774024).

In response to the scary warning that Facebook add to the developer console,
[James Bridle](http://booktwo.org/) has created a script you can run on your
website to make the console more friendly to users who stumble upon it by
mistake.  Viewing the source and using the browser to make changes to see how
things work is one of the best ways we have to encourage people to learn about
how the web works.
