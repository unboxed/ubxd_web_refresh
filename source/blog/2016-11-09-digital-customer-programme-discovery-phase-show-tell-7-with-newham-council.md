It’s been two weeks since I attended [Show & Tell #5](https://unboxed.co/blog/digital-customer-programme-discovery-phase-show-tell-5-with-newham-council/) at Newham Council, so back along I came for the next weekly Show & Tell to see the progress the Digital Team have made across Sprint Seven of their 10-week Digital Customer Programme Discovery Phase.<br/>

More and more new faces are coming along to this weekly session, indicating that the positive word of what the team is achieving is positively spreading, as the phase progresses to transform the way Newham Council deliver key services to their local residents.<br/>


# Digital Discovery - Sprint Seven
<i>Show & Tell duration: 20 minutes</i><br/>

Led by [Martyn](https://unboxed.co/people/#martyn-evans), Boris, Baljit and Ikram, the Digital Team shared the progress that has been made across Sprint Seven:<br/>

- Testing a variety of prototype services with local residents
- Reviewing these prototypes with key stakeholders in each area of service
- Further sketching and iterating on a variety of prototypes
- Attending a [GOV.UK Verify](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify) workshop to gain a better understanding of residential verification

The Show & Tell then drilled down into the various areas of focus:<br/>

# 1. Local Offer
Local Offer is a platform to provide information to families on what local support services are available for children and young people with special educational needs or disabilities. With a potential local offering for residents, progress reached with the current prototype includes:<br/>

- Taking a Local Offer service leader through the current user journey
- Gathering feedback by testing this with local residents
- Sending out and gathering back surveys from parents
- Asking potential users for the type of results they would prefer to see provided

# 2. Homeless booking flow
The team addressed the booking flow of a homelessness service prototype by:<br/>

- Meeting with service stakeholders at a homelessness triage centre for further testing
- Looking at other similar systems across other councils 
- Comparing what types of information might be necessary within this system when it comes to user needs and requirements

From iterating on the previous prototypes shared in the Show & Tell for Sprint Six:<br/>

- Further user feedback, in the form of conversations and interviews with stakeholders at the homeless triage center, has been gathered
- This has then been used and applied to further iterations on the next stage of the prototype
- The team are now constantly addressing the question: “Can we do more to help both residents and the council team?”

# 3. Housing Register service prototype
Showcasing the first iteration of the Housing Register prototype service, Boris led the room through:<br/>

- A suggestion of a potential user journey within the service
- The different ideas being tested, such as engaging with residents by using more “natural” language and focusing on using terms and phrases they may use
- Addressing what relevant information is required before entering the service
- First drafts of what information needs to be available after a user makes a submission, in order to give an indication of what to expect in the next stage of the process

Taking feedback from the other services being worked on and applying it to this Housing Register service prototype has allowed the team to test the inclusion of potential required features, such as a timeline to indicate the overall process and which stage users are at in the process throughout their journey.<br/>

# 4. Housing Repairs prototype
Housing Repairs is the improved system for residents to successfully book repairs to their property online. Progress with the Housing Repairs prototype was shared by Baljit, leading the room through:<br/>

- The process of how users book housing repair online using their mobile device
- The new customer journey involves residents logging into their account
- Taking each step to logging a repair by providing the relevant information at each stage of the process

This user journey has been improved through further user interviewing and shadowing in customer contact centres. The next step is shadowing a repairs appointment to take a tenant through this prototype service while their repair is being carried out to show how this will work for them, and gather further feedback.<br/>

# What’s next on the roadmap?

![Show & Tell 7 with Newham Council 6](http://i1291.photobucket.com/albums/b548/grammccram/IMG_6840_zpsu0azzcme.jpg)

One of the biggest main priorities on the team’s roadmap is to now base themselves solely in the council’s Housing office, based in Stratford. Co-locating with the Housing team and focusing even more on engaging with residents in other parts of the borough is all about reaching more service users. With the finish line crossed for Sprint Seven, it’s now into Sprint Eight in this 10-week Digital Customer Programme Discovery Phase.
