## Wealth, in pictures - [Crystal](/people#chris-carter)

http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/03/combined-wealth-world.html

A bit of an old article now, but shows (in interesting and visualisable ways)
how the wealth of the world is split. I like the idea of climbing 68% of the
way to the moon on money.

## [Discussion Thread] What simple tools or products are you most proud of making? - [Charlie](/people#charlie-egan)

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12957371

Spent over an hour reading this thread; people have posted all sorts of
interesting side projects. Some highlights for me:

* [followww.co](https://followww.co/) - visualises redirects and cookies set along the way;
* [launchaco.com](http://launchaco.com/) - a faster more complete domainr
* [imguru](https://github.com/FigBug/imguru) - uploads images to Imgur from the command line
* [transfer.sh](https://transfer.sh) - a simple CLI for file transfers.

## Track of the Week - [Elena](https://twitter.com/elenatanasoiu)

It's a song from Icelandic singer Asgeir. All his songs makes me relax and focus during the workday. Enjoy!
