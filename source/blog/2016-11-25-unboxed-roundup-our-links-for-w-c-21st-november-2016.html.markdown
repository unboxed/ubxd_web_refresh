## Rspec Christmas Tree  - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

https://github.com/elabs/christmas_tree_formatter

Since we're approaching Christmas at a ridiculously fast pace and seeing
Christmas decorations is finally a reasonable thing, I thought I'd share
this gem which formats your rspec output in the shape of a christmas tree.
There's a pull request for adding blinking snow, which I'm hoping will be
merged!

## IronFunctions - [Charlie Egan](/people#charlie-egan)

https://github.com/iron-io/functions

Disclaimer; I haven't used this yet. The project is means of setting up DIY
functions as a service. It looks like it's pretty easy to setup and that it
ought to be possible to run super cheaply on [hyper.sh](https://console.hyper.sh/register/invite/leKWeNqqKgh9RJxM0Mm3T8d27GKJ3qUL)
(that's my referral link - gets us both some free credits). It runs functions
in containers so how you write your functions is pretty flexible.

## Fun things in Elixir - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

https://dev.to/ryanflach/fun-things-in-elixir

This is a nice intro into some of the quirks of Elixir. As a beginner myself,
I found these were a nice exploration of some things that make Elixir different.
I especially liked that you can do method chaining using the `|>` operator.
Function definition with clauses was also interesting.

## Writing tests - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

http://www.marclittlemore.com/how-to-write-high-quality-unit-tests/

I find it hard to articulate exactly what a good unit test looks like.  It's
something I know when I see, but I find it hard to explain to someone else what
I would or wouldn't test, and what level of abstraction I'd test at to get the
most confidence about making future changes.  This is obviously my own failing,
as this article by Marc Littlemore clearly describes what to think about when
writing good unit tests and provides useful steps to follow.

## 12 Fractured Apps (2015) - [Charlie](/people#charlie-egan)

https://medium.com/@kelseyhightower/12-fractured-apps-1080c73d481c

A short & accesible write up about writing resilient applications. While it
uses containerized apps as an example, the ideas about handling interactions
with the environment are more generally applicable. If you're interested in
containers, Kelsey Hightower has a lot of interesting project and tutorials
on his [GitHub](https://github.com/kelseyhightower?tab=repositories) Profile.

## Track of the Week - [Tom Gladhill](/people#tom-gladhill)

20 years young this week, it's the ever fresh DJ Shadow's Organ Donor.
