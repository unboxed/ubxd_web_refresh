## Rspec Christmas Tree  - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

https://github.com/elabs/christmas_tree_formatter

Since we're approaching Christmas at a ridiculously fast pace and seeing
Christmas decorations is finally a reasonable thing, I thought I'd share
this gem which formats your rspec output in the shape of a christmas tree.
There's a pull request for adding blinking snow, which I'm hoping will be
merged!
