## LessPass: Next-Gen Open Source Password Manager - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

https://lesspass.com

Even if AES-256 has so far proven unbreakable; maybe we don't need to store
passwords at all. LessPass uses a combination of the domain; username and
master password to re-generate your password each time it's required. There's
also an optional, self hosted encrypted password store for passwords and a cool
emoji-hash indicator to make sure you're entering your master password
correctly ([see here](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/unboxed-web-images/872e129d0c3805decf097c4a558d2163.gif)).

## How H.264 works - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/

Early in this article about how the h.264 video codec works [Sid
Bala](https://sidbala.com) shows the filesizes for a png of a webpage and a 5
second h.264 encoded video of the same image.  The video is __17%__ of the size
of the image.  This is pretty amazing.  The rest of the article goes into the
tricks that h.264 plays to achieve that compression. It's well worth your time
to read this even if you've never really thought about video encodings.
