## LessPass: Next-Gen Open Source Password Manager [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

https://lesspass.com

Even if AES-256 has so far proven unbreakable; maybe we don't need to store
passwords at all. LessPass uses a combination of the domain; username and
master password to re-generate your password each time it's required. There's
also an optional, self hosted encrypted password store for passwords and a cool
emoji-hash indicator to make sure you're entering your master password
correctly ([see here](https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*wgrq2WIxhyBSfL1Tbr5Qbw.gif)).

## Track of the Week - [Boris D](/people#boris-divjak)

It’s Say a Little Prayer by Aretha Franklin. It’s a perfect morning song and I like to listen to it during breakfast. Gets my spirits up!
