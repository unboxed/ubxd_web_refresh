Hello, I’m Boris. New to the team, I’ve recently joined Unboxed as a Designer.<br/>

With over 12 years of experience in creating digital services, I'm a Service Designer with an interdisciplinary background (BA in Graphic Design, MDes in Service Design).<br/>

![Welcome to the team Boris 1](http://i1291.photobucket.com/albums/b548/grammccram/dcc7431b-ae40-448c-a70f-3da8706223e6_zpse9zmjwhj.jpg)

I’ve worked with a range of studios and agencies, as well as a number of digital startups, collaborating on projects around digital, service and platform design. In addition to more commercial projects for clients such as Ford or Tesco, I have in recent years had a chance to work on a number of public sector and social innovation projects, aiming to leverage service design and design thinking to solve complex systemic societal issues.<br/>

I’m originally from Slovenia and have lived and worked in London since 2012. In my free time, I enjoy discovering all the wonderful things London has to offer, from art and design exhibitions to music events, and of course the occasional pint of locally brewed ale. When I want to get away from the buzz, I like to take a stroll along Regent’s Canal or a run in Victoria Park.<br/>

The first project I’m working on, as part of the Unboxed team, is a Digital Customer Programme Discovery Phase with Newham Council. Our team is collaborating with the Digital Team over at Newham to take the first steps in transforming how they deliver some of their key services. Working on-site gives us the chance to really understand their culture and enables us to help them transition into a more agile way of working.<br/>

The team at Newham have been very eager to take a step out of their comfort zone and have been conducting interviews, sketching sessions, prototyping new solutions and testing concepts with residents. They’re growing more confident as new insights are taking shape with every iteration and it’s nice to see that other Council employees are now getting interested in their good work. As I have not worked within a team embedded in an organisation before, this is a great experience for me as it allows me to see the design process from a different perspective.<br/>


As a new addition to the Unboxed design team I’m looking forward to working on more challenging, complex projects like the one in Newham, as this is where design can really make a difference. I really like the approach that Unboxed has towards these projects and, as our design team grows, I hope to be able to contribute and further develop our methods as much as I can.<br/>
