## Track of the Week - [Martin E](/people#martyn-evans)

I've been in Cape Town this week running Techqala (our start-up accelerator - http://www.techqala.com/) and I brought my 17 year old son along for the ride. We managed to get away for an afternoon to explore and he took control of the car stereo, introducing me to "Kendrick". Here's what Stanley says about the track: "Lyrically the song is very good both in technique and meaning, it has a very catchy beat and it comes with a fun video as well."
