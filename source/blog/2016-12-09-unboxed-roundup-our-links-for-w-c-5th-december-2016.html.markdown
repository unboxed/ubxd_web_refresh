## ZType: A Typing Game - [Tom S](/people#tom-sabin)

http://zty.pe/

Destroy invading spaceships with this fun typing game.

## semantic-rs - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

https://github.com/semantic-rs/semantic-rs

Earlier in the year I wrote up a [sub-graph matching
package](https://crates.io/crates/graph_match) in Rust. Published packages
(crates) require the version to be set correctly; I'd done this manually and
it's just another thing to remember to do. I haven't used semantic-rs but it
looks pretty useful for helping automate the process. I've not yet come across
an equivalent for Ruby.

## An introduction to ITCSS - [Tom S](/people#tom-sabin)

https://medium.okgrow.com/building-a-maintainable-and-scalable-css-codebase-with-itcss-ceda5b2f495b#.5o22hszg5

Oliver Thomas Klein gives a nice introduction to ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS),
a methodology to help organise your CSS.

##  Yes, progressive enhancement is a fucking moral argument - Rich A

https://sonniesedge.co.uk/blog/progressive-enhancement

I make no bones about the fact that I am utterly pro-Progressive Enhancement,
but a [certain article](https://www.viget.com/articles/the-case-against-progressive-enhancements-flimsy-moral-foundation)
published this week by (I assume) a Project Manager, who appears to have heard
some Ember developers having a bitching session one time and decided to write
about it, highlighted to me quite how many people misunderstand PE to be solely
about how "*all websites should be able to work without JS*" (spoilers: it's
not).

Rising out of the various Tweetstorms arose 2 response articles of note - one,
[an articulate and thoughtful](https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/insert-clickbait-headline-about-progressive-enhancement-here/)
reply that goes out its way to explain the underlying principles of PE, and why
it is a necessary step in web development, written by one of the champions of
PE [Aaron Gustafson](https://twitter.com/aarongustafson); and the other, a...
[more passionate and entertaining read](https://sonniesedge.co.uk/blog/progressive-enhancement).

Note: I linked the second article in header not because it was any 'better' than
the first - they're both great; but mainly because it having a swearword in
the title meant you were more likely to read this whole blurb.

Sorry for manipulating you like that.

## Finding The Fake-News King - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/12/02/504155809/episode-739-finding-the-fake-news-king

Short podcast episode about fake news that includes an brief interview with
someone running a number of fake news sites. Interesting to hear the story from
the other side. The interview is written up
[here](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/23/503146770/npr-finds-the-head-of-a-covert-fake-news-operation-in-the-suburbs).

##  Robotic pen draws & writes - [Tom S](/people#tom-sabin)

https://vimeo.com/193294744

So satisfying to watch that it's almost therapeutic.

## Track of the Week - [Martin E](/people#martyn-evans)

I've been in Cape Town this week running Techqala (our start-up accelerator -
http://www.techqala.com/) and I brought my 17 year old son along for the ride.
We managed to get away for an afternoon to explore and he took control of the
car stereo, introducing me to "Kendrick". Here's what Stanley says about the
track: "Lyrically the song is very good both in technique and meaning, it has
a very catchy beat and it comes with a fun video as well."
