## Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2017 - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/92SGNSF

Each year stackoverflow asks lots of questions to lots of developers and does a
nice write up of the results. Last year they had over 50k responses & did a nice
write up of the results [here](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016).

## Ruby 2.4 Hashes - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://blog.heroku.com/ruby-2-4-features-hashes-integers-rounding

Another year passes and another version of Ruby is released as a Christmas
present for the ruby community.  This article explains some of the new features
and changes.  I particularly enjoyed the deep-dive explanation of how hashes
work, and how tweaking the implementation has made them much faster in ruby 2.4.

## The Cloudcast #281 - Monoliths and Microservices - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

http://www.thecloudcast.net/2016/12/the-cloudcast-281-monoliths-and.html

An interview with [Anders Wallgren](https://twitter.com/anders_wallgren) with a
more balanced take on the Monolith vs. Microservices discussion. The take away
for me was that 'monolith problems' often stem from process or organizational
culture and that microservices can't fix that.

## Textures.js - [Charlie E](http://riccardoscalco.github.io/textures)

I've had various interesting discussions with [petition map
Cale](https://twitter.com/tlfrd) about heat-maps, cartograms and choropleths and
how colour can introduce bias. Maybe textures would work better?
