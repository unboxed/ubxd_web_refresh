title: 'Digital Customer Programme: Show & Tell #12 with Newham Council'
---
Here we are - Show & Tell #12 with Digital Team, and the first of 2017. With a room full of refreshed attendees from the festive break, it’s time to see what’s been happening across the lastest sprint of the Digital Customer Programme with [Newham Council](https://www.newham.gov.uk/Pages/index.aspx).<br/>

The Digital Customer Programme launched last year, with a mission of transforming the way key digital services are delivered to the 325,000 local residents of the London Borough of Newham. An Unboxed team is currently working in collaboration with the Digital Team to run a number of the council’s services through an Agile design and delivery process aligned with the GDS Digital Service Standard.<br/>

# Digital Customer Programme: Sprint 12
<i>Show & Tell duration: 20 minutes</i><br/>

Led by [Boris](https://unboxed.co/people/#boris-divjak) (Service Designer) and Dawn (Website Product Manager), the Digital Team began by sharing the good news that the team is now growing. Expanding by two additional members, the team are welcoming a new developer and a customer services representative. As some services are moving into (and through) the Alpha Phase, as well as additional services due to enter into the Discovery Phase, a larger team is now required to continue delivering results, keeping the momentum of the project going.<br/>

# Alpha Phase: Homelessness service
Homelessness is the first service to progress into Alpha, having successfully passed through the Discovery Phase in the weeks leading up to the Christmas break. With Sprint #11 used to begin preparing for this upcoming Phase, progress made across the last sprint includes:<br/>

- Kick-starting progress with an initial workshop, getting all key stakeholders together to discuss, agree and set the main goals of the Alpha
- Welcoming a new developer to the team to begin exploring the technical side of the service and how this might look
- Planning the prototyping and testing of web content, the booking system for Homelessness Triage Centre appointments and exploring the technical integrations with existing systems through APIs
