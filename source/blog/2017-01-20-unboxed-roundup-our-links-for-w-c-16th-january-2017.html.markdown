## Squib - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

http://squib.rocks

I spent a [recent Hackday](https://unboxed.co/blog/unboxed-hackathon-2-all-in-an-innovation-day-s-work/)
working on a simple app to generate art for playing cards. Squib is a ruby DSL
for generating & laying out cards - looks like a cool project.

## Everything you need to know about HTTP security headers - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

https://blog.appcanary.com/2017/http-security-headers.html

An article describing how to properly use HTTP security headers and what are
some of the pitfalls of not using them correctly. It offers information on how
to implement them in Rails, Django, Express.js, Go, Nginx, and Apache. There is
also a [gem](https://github.com/twitter/secureheaders) made by Twitter which
applies all these recommendations for you, and a few more.

## Invisible Captcha - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

https://github.com/markets/invisible_captcha

Simple gem for unobtrusive spam rejection in Rails. We rolled our own version
of this in a recent project but it's something that would be nice to reuse on
other public forms.
