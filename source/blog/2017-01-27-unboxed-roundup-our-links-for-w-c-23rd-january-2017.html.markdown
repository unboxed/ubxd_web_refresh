## Rainbows and Unicorns - [Ben W](/people#ben-wong)

http://randsinrepose.com/archives/rainbows-and-unicorns/

Compliments are something I struggle with - I need all the help I can get. This
nice breakdown and guide to giving good ones seems handy.

## C++ Compiler Explorer - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

http://godbolt.org

This is a cool project that interactively shows, for a given C++ program, the
resulting Assembly Code. It's also interesting to see the difference compiler
optimizations make, e.g. [without](https://godbolt.org/g/9DYQmF) vs.
[with](https://godbolt.org/g/JEULQ5)

## PandoraBots - [Crystal](/people#chris-carter)

http://www.pandorabots.com/

A site I found for creating your own chatbots, using XML to define behaviours
and responses. I'm still scratching the surface on what it can do, and it also
has a (fairly basic) Ruby SDK found at https://github.com/spontena/pb-ruby.

## Where's Susi? Airborne Orangutan Tracking with Python and React.js - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

https://dirkgorissen.com/2016/04/19/wheres-susi-airborne-orangutan-tracking-with-python-and-react-js/

This is a side project that produced a fully automated drone for gathering data
on the location of rehabilitated Orangutans. (This project was subject of the
opening talk of HNLondon this week)

## Track of the Week - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

In Lonely Majesty - a Danish band with mucho talent from Denmarkâ€™s second city, Aarhus. Aarhus is the European Capital
of Culture in 2017 so it seems like an appropriate choice.
