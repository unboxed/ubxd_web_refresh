## Rainbows and Unicorns - [Ben W](/people#ben-wong)

http://randsinrepose.com/archives/rainbows-and-unicorns/

Compliments are something I struggle with - I need all the help I can get. This
nice breakdown and guide to giving good ones seems handy.

## PandoraBots - [Crystal](/people#chris-carter)

http://www.pandorabots.com/

A site I found for creating your own chatbots, using XML to define behaviours
and responses. I'm still scratching the surface on what it can do, and it also
has a (fairly basic) Ruby SDK found at https://github.com/spontena/pb-ruby.

## Track of the Week - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

In Lonely Majesty - a Danish band with mucho talent from Denmarkâ€™s second city, Aarhus. Aarhus is the European Capital
of Culture in 2017 so it seems like an appropriate choice.
