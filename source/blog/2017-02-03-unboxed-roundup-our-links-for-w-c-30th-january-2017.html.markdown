## Static Site Generators - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

https://staticsitegenerators.net/

A static site generator for every language. I feel like I missed someone
influential claiming static site generators are literally _the best_ side
project ever. Good list nonetheless.

## PostgreSQL's Powerful Lateral Join - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

https://blog.heapanalytics.com/postgresqls-powerful-new-join-type-lateral/

Although it was introduced a few iterations ago, in Postgres 9.3, the LATERAL
join is worth a mention since it allows you to go over each resulting row of a
query and perform a second sub-query. This is also cool because the subquery
can take parameters. The subqueries are not evaluated independently so you
have access to the results from previous executions.

## awesome-bits - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

https://github.com/keon/awesome-bits

Another (more awesome) list. Basically it's a write up of bit wise operations
of varying complexity, most of the simple ones work in Ruby too.

## Doors - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

http://www.lizengland.com/blog/2014/04/the-door-problem/

In my time I've certainly played enough games to understand the specific design
problem that Liz England describes for doors in game worlds.  That's not the
only reason I like this article though.  It makes me think about other design
choices I might make when building software and reminds me that if it seems
"simple" I might need to think a bit more about it to understand the true impact
on other users.

## Track of the Week - [Leon O K](/people#leon-odey-knight)

...gloriously fragile, yet overwhelmingly powerful. Like the innocent memories of youth are fogged by excess.
