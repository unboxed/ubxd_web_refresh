## Emergency Codes - [Claire K](/people#claire-kemp)

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/The-emergency-codes-youre-not-supposed-to-know-about/

I don't know about you but, with the rise of terror attacks in cities that I
have visited before, I am on edge if I see a police person. So the other day
when I heard an announcement for a "code 4"  as I came out of the train station,
I googled it.

Unfortunately it was not that interesting.

## Servo Starters - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

https://starters.servo.org/

An idea for an upcoming Hackday was to work on some open source projects. The
Rust community & mozilla have a number of initiatives for new contributors.
_Servo Starters_ is one such initiative for the servo browser engine that lists
issues suitable for beginners as well as highlighting mentored.

## Online migrations at scale - [Chris H](/people#chris-holmes)

https://stripe.com/blog/online-migrations

This article provides an interesting insight into the migration strategy
employed by Stripe when redesigning a part of their data model. It details a
common 4 step dual writing pattern, their approach, and some of the tools and
frameworks that they use. I particularly liked their use of Github's
[Scientist](https://github.com/github/scientist) library to alert them to any
inconsistencies during the process in a safe way.

## Scale API - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

https://www.scaleapi.com/

Not sure if anyone else has used [Amazon Mechanical
Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) before but this is a similar service
for "intelligence as a service" with a nice API (that I haven't used yet).
There's also an [SE Daily
episode](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/12/16/scale-api-with-lucy-guo-and-alexandr-wang/)
with an interview for those into podcasts.
