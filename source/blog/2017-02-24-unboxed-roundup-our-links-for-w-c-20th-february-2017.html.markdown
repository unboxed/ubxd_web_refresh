## Graphical depiction of ownership and borrowing in Rust - [Charlie](/people#charlie-egan)

https://rufflewind.com/2017-02-15/rust-move-copy-borrow

I know this is kind of specific but I also know I'm not the only one here
that's interested in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). It's also a really
good diagram for something that's not easily understood. There's even a [PDF
version](https://rufflewind.com/img/rust-move-copy-borrow.pdf) for making
posters to spread the good word.

## Making animations from a series of images - [Tom S](/people#tom-sabin)

Using ImageMagick (installable from homebrew), you can do some cool simple
things like creating an animated GIF using the `convert` command. Take the
example below, where Iâ€™m inside a directly of images which have been ordered
sequentially:

```
/usr/local/bin/convert -delay 100 -loop 0 * ~/Desktop/animated.gif
```

This creates an `animated.gif` image which loops endlessly and has a delay of
100 ticks per second. If you want the animation faster then decrease the ticks.

## Here's What TfL Learned From Tracking Your Phone On the Tube - [Charlie](/people#charlie-egan)

http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2017/02/heres-what-tfl-learned-from-tracking-your-phone-on-the-tube/

Setting any privacy concerns aside; I think these results from tracking
passengers around the tube network is really interesting. TFL took efforts
to protect privacy and make passengers aware (I noticed the posters). As well
as the larger 'traffic flow' maps; there's also a plan drawing of a station
with journey times annotated.

## PostgreSQL Vacuuming: An Introduction for Busy Devs - [Chris H](/people#chris-holmes)

http://okigiveup.net/postgresql-vacuuming-an-introduction-for-busy-devs/

A project I've been working on recently had issues with PostgreSQL vacuuming
and dead rows in a number of their large and more active tables. I found the
[PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/routine-vacuuming.html)
to be very useful and this link gives a nice overview of vacuuming, why it is
used and how it can be improved.

## Track of the Week - [Sarah B](/people#sarah-beck)

It always seems I get to do this the week before holiday!
So, this time I am off skiing, with my family. And this song was playing on repeat on a holiday in Italy when
I was younger, so reminds me of family holidays!
