## Why Typography Matters â€” Especially At The Oscars - [Andrew W](/people#andrew-white)

https://medium.freecodecamp.com/why-typography-matters-especially-at-the-oscars-f7b00e202f22

Typography is a crucial element of good design and we see it all around us
everyday from billboards to road signs. So when you're in a high pressure
environment like presenting an award with millions of people watching what

items in your house, this article explains how the same technology can be
automated using a Raspberry Pi and an AI script. The AI spies on your products
using a camera and decides whether it's time to re-order items in your house.

accidentally moving my food from its expected position and winding up with
too much of it.
