## What does it mean to be "senior"? - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/

It can be hard to define what a "senior"" engineer/developer/programmer<sup>[*](#fn-1)</sup>
actually is.  I think we can all agree that it can't just be someone who has 
been working for a few years and has some experience, even though that's 
probably one requirement we'd all agree on (even if we don't all agree on how
long they'd have to be working for).  This article tries to describe what a 
senior engineer does, and brings it down to maturity.  I found this a useful
article as I start to struggle with what kind of "senior" I am, and what kind 
of "senior" I want to be.
