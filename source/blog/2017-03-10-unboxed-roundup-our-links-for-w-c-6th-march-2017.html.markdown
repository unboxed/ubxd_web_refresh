## What does it mean to be "senior"? - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/

It can be hard to define what a "senior"" engineer/developer/programmer<sup>[*](#fn-1)</sup>
actually is.  I think we can all agree that it can't just be someone who has 
been working for a few years and has some experience, even though that's 
probably one requirement we'd all agree on (even if we don't all agree on how
long they'd have to be working for).  This article tries to describe what a 
senior engineer does, and brings it down to maturity.  I found this a useful
article as I start to struggle with what kind of "senior" I am, and what kind 
of "senior" I want to be.

## Scrimba - [Charlie](/people#charlie-egan)

https://scrimba.com

This is a tool to create short video demonstrations of simple web 'programs'. Sort of like [asciinema](https://asciinema.org) only more... webby?

## Google Cloud Container Builder - [Charlie](/people#charlie-egan)

https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/03/Google-Cloud-Container-Builder-a-fast-and-flexible-way-to-package-your-software.html

I spent a few innovation days playing with various container-based continuous
deployment tools last year. I played with both [Wercker](http://www.wercker.com)
and [Distelli](https://www.distelli.com) but found both had their quirks when deploying
to a GCE cluster. I've yet to play with GCCB but hopefully better ease of use will
come from the closer integration.

## Faster RSpec - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

I found this article interesting because it describes how you can use a profiling tool to optimize your usage of FactoryGirl. The tool is called, unsurprisingly, FactoryGirlProfiler. It allows you to see which factories are taking up the most time, and hopefully give you a better picture of your usage.

## Track of the Week - [Matt T](/people#matt-turrell)

This is one of my faves at the moment, I love it because it's uplifting and hints at summer fun!
