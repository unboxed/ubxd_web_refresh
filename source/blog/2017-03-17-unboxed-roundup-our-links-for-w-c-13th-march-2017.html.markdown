### How the tech sector could move in One Direction - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

http://www.sachajudd.com/one-direction/

This talk by [Sacha Judd](http://www.sachajudd.com/) (available as a video and transcript with better gifs) has two parts.  The first is a story about engaging in a fandom that you aren't the target market for, in this case One Direction fans that think Liam and Harry are a couple.  The second is about diversity, and how the lack of it in the tech sector makes everything worse. The bridge between the two is that Sacha found the primarily young and female members of the fan community to be incredibily tech-savvy, but also that most of them felt their self-taught know-how wasn't good enough to get jobs in tech. It's a great talk, with a strong message: it's long past time we did something to fix the problem.
