## You are @ 10K Apart - [Charlie](/team#charlie-egan)

https://a-k-apart.com/#winners

This was a website competition where submissions had to deliver a usable
experience in under 10KB of transferred content. Some submissions are better
than others but I thought it was a good competition idea.


## Why you shouldn't use ENV variables for secret data - [Charlie](/team#charlie-egan)

https://diogomonica.com/2017/03/27/why-you-shouldnt-use-env-variables-for-secret-data

Bit of a clickbait title... a short write up commenting on some of the problems
that can arise from storing secrets in environment variables. There's also a
(docker specific) alternative explained that allows secrets to be encrypted at
rest.


## Using your device's light sensor to steal browser data - [Abraao M](/team#abraao-mota)

https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/stealing-sensitive-browser-data-with-the-w3c-ambient-light-sensor-api/

These researchers argue against a proposal to use sensor data without asking for
user permission by showing it's possible to exfiltrate browser data (such as
account recovery QR codes) by flashing the screen. It's a fairly slow to exploit
in a real scenario but shows the dangers of exposing sensitive API's.

## Track of the Week - [Murray S](/team#murray-steele)

You know who is brilliant?  It's Björk.  It's always Björk.  I can't think of
a situation that wouldn't be improved by a Björk soundtrack.  What I'm saying is
that you should probably be listening to more Björk.  In fact, why not listen to
some now:
