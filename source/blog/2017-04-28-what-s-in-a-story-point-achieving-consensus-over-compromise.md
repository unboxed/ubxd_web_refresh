There’s no doubt about it, sprint planning sessions can sometimes get a bit… tedious.<br/>

Lots of talk and not much coding doesn’t always make for a chirpy team by lunchtime.<br/>

Depending on the team size and personalities, some things which I’d assume would be a quick conversation followed by a decision can become drawn out.<br/>

Something I’ve learnt as a Scrum Master is that consensus within a team is much more valuable than compromise.<br/>

If you bring the whole team along on the journey, rather than forcing a compromise, what results is a great team bond, strong commitment to delivery and a shared understanding each sprint of what they’re trying to achieve and how.<br/>

The difference between each team member’s communication style can be dramatic. I’ve frequently worked with teams with people near both ends of the introvert / extrovert spectrum.<br/>

Just because someone is quiet, it doesn’t mean they don’t have a valuable perspective to add to a conversation. Just as someone who is on the louder side doesn’t have all the answers (or perspectives).<br/>

By facilitating a conversation in a sensitive and patient way, you can help the whole team understand all the perspectives and achieve consensus.<br/>

Sometimes, I do this to further consolidate team collaboration, mutual respect and team spirit, rather than just to get a decision on the matter at hand.<br/>

An example of this occurred in a recent planning session. As a result of playing planning poker, there was some debate about whether a story should be estimated as 2 or 3 story points.<br/>

It was a large group and I allowed the conversation to go on for 10 minutes or so.<br/>

An old fashioned way of looking at this would be to equate that time to one ‘person-hour’ of work, for a conversation about a single story point.<br/>

However, the value of this exercise wasn’t in obtaining a super-accurate story point estimate (an oxymoron anyway), it was in deepening team communication and the team bond.<br/>

The developer arguing for the lower estimate was making a valid point about referring to our benchmark user story and helping the team properly consider what was required to implement the story.<br/>

When the team re-voted, they arrived at a consensus of 3 story points. Everyone had had a chance to voice their view, had a clear understanding of how they’d implement the story and an understanding of the risk level associated with it.<br/>

Value for both the sprint (and therefore project delivery) and for the team, all in 10 minutes.<br/>

I recommend always aiming for consensus over compromise. This will take a bit longer, but it’s worth it.
