In my [last post](https://unboxed.co/blog/what-s-in-a-story-point-achieving-consensus-over-compromise/), I talked about the value of getting everyone’s perspectives during planning sessions (actually, I’d advocate doing so in all conversations).<br/>

It just so happens that last weekend I played a great collaborative game with my sister, brother-in-law and partner.<br/>

The game was [a boxed escape the room puzzler](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thames-Kosmos-692681-EXiT-Abandoned/dp/B06WP2G52Z/ref=sr_1_2?s=kids&ie=UTF8&qid=1491903019&sr=1-2&keywords=exit+the+game) and was super-fun.<br/>

Between us, we had a police officer, a full-time parent, a Scrum Master and a learning service global programme manager.<br/>

It took us a while to work through all the puzzles in the game, but in every one, at least three of the four of us contributed to its solution.<br/>

All of us see things slightly differently and often a combination of these perspectives lead to more than the sum of the parts.<br/>

The problem is that not everyone necessarily either sees the value of what they add to the conversation or have the confidence to make their voice heard.<br/>

Helping everyone be heard not only drives better solutions, it also leads to happier, more cohesive teams.
