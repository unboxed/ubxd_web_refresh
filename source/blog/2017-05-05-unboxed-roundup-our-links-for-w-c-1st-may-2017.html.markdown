## Programming as a way of thinking - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/programming-as-a-way-of-thinking/

This article explores what has changed as we move our programming tools further
and further up the abstraction stack away from the `1`s and `0`s of machine
code.  We're able to express ideas more clearly than before and even express
some ideas that we couldn't before.  It's a strong argument in favour of
["optimizing for programmer happiness"](http://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#optimize-for-programmer-happiness).

## The AdStage Migration From Heroku To AWS - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

http://highscalability.com/blog/2017/5/1/the-adstage-migration-from-heroku-to-aws.html

Heroku was costing too much but due to quiet neighbours they were getting more
ECU time than they were paying for - which made the migration to AWS more
complicated.

## Curated list of project-based tutorials - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

I saw this recently and thought it was a great link if someone's looking for
ideas when trying to learn a new language. There's some nice classics in there
like implementing a text editor in C, scraping a website with Python, building
an Android Flashlight app, but also trying to build a Minecraft clone or an iOS
Photo Library. I'm enjoying looking through it so you might enjoy it as well.

## Wikitribune - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, is starting the Wikitribune, an online
fact-checking tool that will "present accurate information with real evidence,
so that you can confidently make up your own mind.". Articles will be
fact-checked by both journalists and community members, and will be supported
by an optional monthly subscription. It seems like we're long overdue for such
a tool and all I can say is "shut up and take my money".

## Six programming paradigms that will change how you think about coding - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2014/04/09/six-programming-paradigms-that-will/

An esoteric list of programming languages that you wouldn't normally come across
(well mostly), with some interesting ideas behind them.

## Track of the Week - [Abraao M](/people#abraao-mota)

No Surprises is a cheery track, exactly like you should be ahead of the
weekend. Additionally, itâ€™s from Westworld, and if you havenâ€™t yet seen it,
then you probably should. Youâ€™ve got all weekend to binge on the first season!
Itâ€™s a great show, take my word for it ðŸ˜‰
