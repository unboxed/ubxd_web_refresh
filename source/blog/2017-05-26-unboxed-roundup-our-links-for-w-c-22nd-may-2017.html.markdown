If you're like me and have suffered from choice paralysis browsing Google Fonts then this might be helpful - basically it helps match header and body fonts. They also have a cool [visualization of similar fonts](http://fontjoy.com/projector).

If you've ever tried to install linux without an GUI installer you'll likely find this amusing. There are lots of [other good ones](https://www.sudosatirical.com/articles/man-rather-pleased-with-awfully-written-script).

## Track of the Week - [James C](/people#james-cook)
