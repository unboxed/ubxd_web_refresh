## Basic Performance Analysis - [Ben W](/team#ben-wong)

https://blog.heapanalytics.com/basic-performance-analysis-saved-us-millions/

I've always wanted an easy way to look at what my processes are doing. This
seems very handy for poking at any slow server processes to see what going on.

## Always be learning - [Murray S](/team#murray-steele)

https://medium.com/@sugarpirate/i-am-still-learning-f61c765d657c

I used to give a talk to developers on a bootcamp where I'd try to explain that
the end of the bootcamp wasn't going to be the end of their "learning to be a
developer" journey.  Pretty much all you do as a developer is learn about new
tools, libraries, programming languages, architectures, methodologies, etc.
[Laura Tan's](https://twitter.com/sugarpirate_) article explains it much more
clearly than I ever did.

## The Tectonic Typesetting System - [Charlie](/team#charlie-egan)

https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io

If you've written documents in TeX you'll likely remember that the tooling is
pretty frustrating. I haven't used Tectonic but reading the blurb it seems to
have some great features such as automatically looping the processing of TeX
and BibTeX files the minimum number of times.

## Election Data - [Sarah B](people#sarah-beck)

https://yougov.co.uk/uk-general-election-2017/

This updates every day I think with predictions for next week and displays it
by constituency too.

## Pairing with Junior Developers - [Elena T](/team#elena-tanasoiu)

https://www.devmynd.com/blog/2015-1-pairing-with-junior-developers/

As more and more tech teams welcome new coders from bootcamps, people are
debating what's the best way to handle working with junior developers. This is a
nice read about how to structure your pairing session with your local
neighbourhood junior dev.

## Track of the week - [Henry T](/team#henry-turner)

Itâ€™s an early Jamie xx single. I like the steel drums.
