## Product Design Playbook - [Boris D](/people#boris-divjak)

https://uxdesign.cc/product-design-playbook-103d3a5cf2e3

As we’re refining our own version of a mix of Design Thinking / Agile /
Lean methodologies, it’s always interesting to see what others are
thinking and writing about this topic. This article offers a good overview
of some of the principles and approaches we employ ourselves in our
product development work. Via Martyn.

http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/cyoa-choose-your-own-adventure-maps

I loved [Choose Your Own Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure)
game books when I was younger, and then I moved onto the more complex [Fighting
Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Fantasy) and [Lone
Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Wolf_(gamebooks)) books
as I got a bit older.  So it's right up my street to see the structure of
some of these original CYOA game books mapped out.  It's always interesting
to use data visualisation techniques to explore something and give you a
different perspective on it (for example [generating ERD
diagrams of your models](https://github.com/voormedia/rails-erd) to see
dependencies).
