## Ascii Diagram Tool - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

http://asciiflow.com/

I recently wanted to draw a diagram to help illustrate the 
details of a story I was working on.  I wanted to include the
diagram in my comment, rather than attach it as an image so
I thought I would do it as ascii.  The diagram turned out to
be quite complex and beyond my threshold for faffing about
with punctuation to draw it properly.  Luckily asciiflow was
only a google away and so I used that.

## Cooling the tube - [Henry T](/people#henry-turner)

https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/blog/2017/06/10/cooling-the-tube-engineering-heat-out-of-the-underground/

Be warned - this isn't a metaphor. It's about the challenges involved with cooling the London Underground. Considering the weather it feels like a good week to be thinking about this.

## Google Maps now covers Mars and the Moon! - [James C](/people#james-cook)

https://www.google.com/maps/space/mars/@7.189878,-40.5235811,9528848m/data=!3m1!1e3

I always knew this day would come. It seemed like an obvious direction for Google Maps/Earth to head in. You can now explore the Moon and Mars from Google Maps! Frickin' awesome!

## Newquay, Cornwall might have the UK's first SPACEPORT - [James C](/people#james-cook)

https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/21/queens-speech-2017-uk-tech/

The Queen spoke about the UKs 'Space Industry Bill' in her latest speech and apparently Newquay in Cornwall is the ideal candidate for the UK's first spaceport.

## Unlocking Ruby Keywords: Begin, End, Ensure, Rescue - [James C](/people#james-cook)

http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/08/25/unlocking-ruby-keywords-begin-end-ensure-rescue/

Although this might be very basic Ruby for some, I actually found this article very helpful. Sometimes it's good to go back to the basics.

One pattern I've been desperately in need of and didn't realise I could do until now is:

```ruby
@foo ||= begin
  Foo.create(foo_attrs)
end
```
## Luna - [Crystal](http://twitter.com/haironfire907)

http://www.luna-lang.org/

An interesting new "language" which seems like a mix and match from various languages. I'm yet to try it but I'm curious to see if/how it takes off, and who uses it.

## Track of the Week - [Martyn E](/people#martyn-evans)

This is a track by my friend Sean O'Hagan and his band The High Llamas. It's the title track from a performance piece based on conversations overheard in Peckham Square and it's a fine example of Sean's genius.
