It’s 4pm and we’re downstairs in the Draft House. Looking around… There’s tea, there’s cake and there’s peers from local government. This can mean only one thing. It’s the next [LocalGov Digital](http://localgovdigital.info/) London Peer Group LGDSS TeaCamp. Hurrah!<br/>

With welcomes and introductions by [Natalie Taylor](https://twitter.com/NatalieRobson) of City Hall, we’re now heading into the main topic of this TeaCamp session, and why we’re all here today: the Digital Marketplace.<br/>
