It’s 4pm and we’re downstairs in the Draft House. Looking around… There’s tea, there’s cake and there’s peers from local government. This can mean only one thing. It’s the next [LocalGov Digital](http://localgovdigital.info/) London Peer Group LGDSS TeaCamp. Hurrah!<br/>

With welcomes and introductions by [Natalie Taylor](https://twitter.com/NatalieRobson) of City Hall, we’re now heading into the main topic of this TeaCamp session, and why we’re all here today: the Digital Marketplace.<br/>

So, to begin, what is the Digital Marketplace?<br/>

The Digital Marketplace is transforming the way in which the public sector are procuring and buying digital, helping them to be able to buy what they need to deliver great digital services, whether this is technology or people.<br/>

Before the introduction of the Digital Marketplace, there were an abundance of issues. The public sector were:<br/>

- Spending a huge amount of money on big technology solutions
- Being locked into long and lengthy contacts, with little-to-no flexibility around changing or adapting these along the way
- Often awarding contracts to a tiny group of huge, well-known suppliers
- Not always sure of what it was buying...

This was a problem. The public sector needed solutions which were:<br/>

- Fast-paced and more flexible
- Adaptable to change
- Easier and faster to buy
- Value for money

How do you make procurement work for you? You adapt it to your needs. Addressing these problems, the introduction of Digital Marketplace has:<br/>

- Opened the door to a much broader range of supplies, making it easier for SMEs to apply to work with the public sector, encouraging much more competitive pricing for buyers
- Cut down these long and lengthy contracts 
- Made it easier for subject experts to buy without needing a deep knowledge of procurement - the buying process is much simpler, where a supplier can submit what services they can provide and a buyer can pick from a full list
- Helped to keep things fair and open by working towards preventing fraud, waste and corruption

# 2009 vs. today
Back in 2009, just a handful of suppliers dominated the market for digital government services. Today, thanks to close collaboration with Crown Commercial Services, over 91% of all suppliers on the Digital Marketplace are now SMEs, making up a total of 3,000+ suppliers.<br/>

# The three frameworks
The Digital Marketplace frameworks are a shared set of terms and conditions between public sector buyers and private sector suppliers, defining:<br/>

- What is being purchased
- Who the seller is
- How the buying process works

Each supplier applies to sell their services through a framework around every 9 months. This allows for new suppliers to join the framework at regular intervals, not just securing one list of suppliers over a long period of time.<br/>

<br/>
With a total of three framework (in total) on the Digital Marketplace, each has a different purpose:<br/>

## Framework #1: Crown Hosting
This is for datacentre hosting services. If, for any reason, your service cannot go onto the Cloud, this is where it goes.<br/>
<br/>

# Framework #2: G-Cloud
This is the most popular framework and is for Cloud services: hosting, software and support. Buyers compare the services that are on offer from each supplier, then award a contract to the single supplier which provides the service that best meets their needs and requirements.<br/>

<br/>
# Framework #3: Digital Outcomes and Specialists
This is the second most popular framework, allowing for buyers to find people, teams and specialists to work on digital services, programmes or projects, with defined scopes and deliverables.<br/>

Presently, there are:<br/>

- 608 unique organisations using the Digital Marketplace
- 2,061 suppliers on the Digital Outcomes and Specialists framework
- 2,848 suppliers on the G-Cloud framework
- 1,119 Digital Outcomes and Specialists briefs/opportunities published

The total current spend of G-Cloud sales is approximately £2billion, with 77% of total sales (by value) through Central Government and 23% through the wider public sector.<br/>
