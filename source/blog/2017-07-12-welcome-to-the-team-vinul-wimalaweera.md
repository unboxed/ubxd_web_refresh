Joining the Unboxed team for a three-month internship across the summer, I’m Vinul.<br/>

I’m currently a student studying Physics at Imperial College London. I am interested in a variety of things tech related from the plausibility of fusion as a renewable energy source to the innovative use of machine learning in modern day applications.<br/>

I'm from Sri Lanka but have also lived in Seychelles, before moving to London 10 years ago. I have been dabbling in all things programming for a few years. My prior experience is predominantly in modelling and running physical tests using Python. I have also tried my hand at Javascript, C and learning some web frameworks.<br/>

My most recent project was the end of year summer project that I did in university. It involved designing and creating an optical communication system using a Raspberry Pi and light source (namely a laser diode/ LED). This gave me the opportunity to test and develop my skills in both programming and electronics.<br/>

I look forward to learning about the Ruby on Rails framework and really getting stuck in. Unboxed also gives me the opportunity to develop my knowledge in a professional environment. I think I will really benefit from the atmosphere of collaboration and support that I have experienced in my first few days here.<br/>

So far, I have been working my way through the 'New Joiner' Induction Board whilst working on integrating zendesk support in the char.gy help page. I’m really excited to get stuck in with more of this project.<br/>

In my spare time, I am an avid coffee drinker and beginner hip hop dancer. I also have a passion for travelling (mainly for the food) and pushing myself out of my comfort zone. My most recent excursion has been to backpack around Southeast Asia for two months.
