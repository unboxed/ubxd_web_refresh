http://heydesigner.com/blog/why-you-should-be-prototyping/

Thoughts on prototyping in engineering teams at Netflix. You should always
be prototyping and testing solutions as early as possible to get things
right. Iterate early and often with your prototypes, and you'll find that
a good design materialises much more quickly.

## Watching Google & Apple maps over a year - [Tom S](/people#tom-sabin)

to switch the emphasis of their map from roads to places. Apple on the
other hand... well, you can see for yourself.

## Track of the Week - [Andrew W](/people#andrew-white)

During the Eighties I was a big fan of Thomas Dolby who later went on to
found the company Beatnik Inc. which became a big player in the polyphonic
ringtone market by getting its player embedded in millions on Nokia
phones. He's recently released a memoir about that whole period of the 90s
called "The Speed of Sound" which looks a really interesting read. Rather
than the obvious selections of "Hyperactive!" or "She blinded me with
science" I decided to go with my personal favourite from his breakthrough
album "The Golden Age of Wireless", which is "Europa and the Pirate Twins".
