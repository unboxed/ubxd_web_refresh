## How to build a better job - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

http://www.npr.org/2017/07/31/540648577/you-2-0-how-to-build-a-better-job

A discussion around crafting the boundaries of your job to make it be more
meaningful to you.

## Typed Nils in Go - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

https://dave.cheney.net/2017/08/09/typed-nils-in-go-2

Writing Ruby, an unexpected `nil` value has likely caused you pain once or
twice. In a language with static typing what does `nil` look like? Why
might nil not always 'equal' nil? This is a post about how this issue can
arise in the Go programming language.

## Font-size: An Unexpectedly Complex CSS Property - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2017/08/10/font-size-an-unexpectedly-complex-css-property

This is a post that sheds some light on the complexity of implementing
font-rendering in a web browser but it also serves as a pretty good
explanation of the surprising way that font-sizes are actually meant to
work. I only got as far as the MathML section - at that point I'd got the
message!

## LSTM neural net to generate Hacker News submissions - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

https://medium.com/@hondanhon/i-trained-an-lstm-neural-net-to-generate-hacker-news-submissions-9213e1225208

I feel like this neural network already understands Hacker News better
than humans. Is it generating titles or is it predicting the future? Some
favorites: "The Simple Command Line Toolkit for Money", "Self-Driving Cars
Using Docker Components" & "Ask HN: How do you manage your data scientists?"

## CSS: what might have been - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-languages-which-almost-became-css/

Most developers will complain about CSS at one point; "it's too verbose",
"it doesn't have variables", "it doesn't support something that's easy
in desktop layout", etc.  Some complaints are valid, some are fixed by
extra tooling like post-processors, and some are fixed by a deeper
understanding of the language.  This article looks at some of the
alternative proposals for styling webpages that could have been chosen.
I'm sure that if any of these had been chosen they wouldn't have
substantively changed how hard it is to apply styling.  We'd still be
complaining about inconsistent support across browsers, and wailing about
how hard it is to implement some designs.  That said, I wonder how
different the whole landscape of web development would have been if the
one based on LISP had been chosen.  Instead of a set of style declarations
we'd have an entire programming language to work with.  Exciting and
terrifying in equal measure I think.

## The evolution of trust - [Ben W](/people#ben-wong)

http://ncase.me/trust

A cool demonstration of a multistage prisoners dilemma - and why it doesn't
pay to be nice all the time.

## ‘Digital Transformation’ Is a Misnomer - [Martyn E](/people#martyn-evans)

http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/digital-transformation-is-a-misnomer/

Nice concise piece on what Digital Transformation is and isn't.

I stared at this for ages wondering how it worked. For the

## Track of the Week - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

If your commute has been a bit soggy this week, this might help with walking like a badass to work.
