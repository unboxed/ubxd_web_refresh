## Ice Cube: Ruby Date Recurrence Library - [Andrew W](/people#andrew-white)

https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube

If you've ever had to deal with repeating events in Ruby then you've
probably had to bend your mind around all the complicated date/time maths.
Throw multiple timezones in for good measure and then you'll soon be
needing some aspirin and a lie down in a dark room. To the rescue is the
Ice Cube library which deals with all the complicated stuff for you, has a
nice fluent API for adding rules and can handle serializing to both YAML
and ICAL for persisting rules to a database.

## Dwarf fortress starting during apt-get upgrade - [Charlie](/people#charlie-egan)

This made me smile - just such an unexpected and unpredictable side effect
of something seemingly completely unrelated.

## Bash Manual - [Charlie](/people#charlie-egan)

https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.txt

After our developer tips and tricks event yesterday I found myself looking
through the bash manual reading about `.inputrc` - turns out it's the
config for `readline`, the library bash uses for reading input. While
reading this I also found `set -o vi` which makes the bash prompt editing
of the current command behave a little bit like vim. This needs to be in
`.bashrc` but it also works in `readline.zsh` for those using zsh.

## A history of internetworking - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

This blog post about IPv4 vs IPv6 explains the history of internetworking
and the series of compromises and hacks that got us into the situation
we're in where IPv4 absolutely doesn't cut it, but IPv6 hasn't been
adopted yet.
