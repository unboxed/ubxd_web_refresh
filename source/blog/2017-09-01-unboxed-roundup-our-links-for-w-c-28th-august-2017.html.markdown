## Awesome Lego Garden Railway - [Charlie](/team#charlie-egan)

This video from 'TrainGuy 659' made me want to revisit my childhood only with a ton more lego train track - seems I didn't get nearly enough the first time round.

## Programming without a screen - [Murray S](/team#murray-steele)

I find that it's always eye-opening to hear how other people, particularly
those with a different set of abilities to me, use a computer.  So this 
description of how a blind programmer works without a screen and the 
affordances that various operating systems and programming tools do 
or don't give him is right up my alley.  The audio snippets are especially
interesting, I could barely keep up with the English audio, let alone
the Finnish audio version reading English text.

## The best time to travel anywhere - [Elena T](/team#elena-tanasoiu)

https://championtraveler.com/best-time-to-travel/

Whenever I get excited about discovering cheap plane tickets to far away places,
I'm always somewhat unsure whether the reason for the price drop is that it's
unsuitable to visit in that period or I just got very lucky. I end up spending 
a lot of time doing research about what the weather is like for a country
in order to decide if it's worth taking the plunge. This tool seems to 
be doing the work for me so I can just type my destination and decide if I'm 
being bamboozled or not.

## Why we're bad at predicting our own happiness - [Elena T](/team#elena-tanasoiu)

http://www.npr.org/2017/08/21/545097480/you-2-0-why-were-bad-at-predicting-our-own-happiness-and-how-we-can-get-better

Daniel Gilbert is a psychologist known for his studies on happiness. In this 
podcast he discusses how humans are pretty bad at making predictions of future 
events and how they're going to react to them. Because of this people are 
predisposed to taking bad decisions about their future and it's a bit improbable
that they're going to improve, since the human mind is always searching for 
something new and different.
