## Outage.Report - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

http://outage.report

This is a crowdsourced status page for hundreds of different services.
Pretty good for things without a status page (e.g. AMEX & many video
games) or when the status page itself goes down (AWS).

## Does serverless architecture make it easier to build things? - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://medium.com/@keithwhor/rise-of-functions-as-a-service-how-php-set-the-serverless-stage-20-years-ago-ccb560c5f422

I'm unsure what I think about serverless architecture, almost certainly
because I've spent my entire career working out how to build things on
servers with big frameworks.  This article made me think about it in a
different light; I've got all this knowledge about servers so I think
server-based web application development is easy, but when I started all
you needed was a cgi-bin script and you had a webapp.  Serverless does
seem to take us back to that simplicity and make it easier for people to
build things.  You never stop learning new things as a developer so I
think it's time for me to unlearn a bunch of stuff so I can explore the
serverless landscape properly.  Caveat: the article is written by someone
who works for a functions as a service startup so there's a certain bias
to their opinions.

## wuzz - [Charlie E](/people#charlie-egan)

https://github.com/asciimoo/wuzz#wuzz

If you've been looking for a terminal replacement for
`${DESKTOP_REST_CLIENT}` this might be it. I've found that I still fall
back to [Paw](https://paw.cloud/) sometimes but I'd really like to get by
without it. The main feature I needed from Paw was being able to save &
reload requests - looks like wuzz does this.
