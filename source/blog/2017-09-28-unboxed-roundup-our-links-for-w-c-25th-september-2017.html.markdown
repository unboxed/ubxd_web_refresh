## Getting ruthless with unnecessary words - [Graeme M](/people#graeme-mccubbin)

https://pds.blog.parliament.uk/2017/08/07/getting-ruthless-with-unnecessary-words/

An insightful, and very practical, blog post by Parliamentary Digital Service on the benefits of cutting and editing content. One of the biggest challenges I find with writing content is trimming and cutting down, but this addresses some of the questions that I should be asking myself more and  more. A great read.

## This has happened before - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://bitquabit.com/post/the-more-things-change/

In this article, [Benjamin Pollack](https://twitter.com/gecko), explains
how React is very similar under the hood to Windows 1.0 GUI programming.
I didn't do any Windows 1.0 programming so I don't feel like I suddenly
"get" react because of this revelation.  I have done a bit of windows
GUI programming in my time though, for the Windows 2000 / XP era, so some
of the things that Benjamin mentions do ring a bell with me and I hope
they'll give me some toehold on the react model when I do start exploring
it properly.  The article also reminds me of [Bret Victor's excellent "The 
Future of Programming" talk](http://worrydream.com/dbx/): all the 
interesting ideas are already out there, we're just rediscovering them.

## The boardgame that takes 1500 hours to complete - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

If you're feeling brave, you could try to assemble a group to play this monster game set in North Africa in WWII. If you and your group meets for three hours at a time, twice a month, you'd wrap up the campaign in about 20 years.

## Mapbox's new kind of map: it's about time - [Tom S](/people#tom-sabin)

https://blog.mapbox.com/a-new-kind-of-map-its-about-time-7bd9f7916f7f

When finding places nearby on a map, the "X minutes" radius around your location is never really accurate, it assumes we can pass through buildings and traffic from A to B as a straight line, just like a ghost might. In this post, Peter Liu from Mapbox, shows a "time map" that removes geography and skews points of interest on the map to the actual walking/cycling/driving distances, while preserving the direction of each place. Try it yourself here: https://www.mapbox.com/labs/timemap/search/ and switch between the different transit modes.

## Hacktoberfest - [Charlie](/people#charlie-egan)

https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com

Automatic free t-shirt for those working on public repos. I've done this two years in a row and the t-shirts have both been _excellent_. 10/10 would recommend.

##30 days time-lapse at sea - [Tom S](/people#tom-sabin)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHrCI9eSJGQ

A mesmerising time-lapse from a container ship, starting at the Red Sea and finishing in Hong Kong. Worth watching as full screen - just sit back and admire the journey for 10 minutes!

##Gource - A software version control visualization tool - [Chris H](/people#chris-holmes)

http://gource.io/

This is a nice tool for visualizing the evolution of a software project. I enjoyed trying it out on a few of the bigger projects I've worked on, give it a go!

## Track of the Week - [Carrie B](/people#carrie-bedingfield)

Everything by Low is pretty spectacular but Try To Sleep is outta this world. If I was Kylie and you were Jason and we were getting married on Neighbours in 2017, this is what I would be coming down the aisle to. THAT is how good this song is.
