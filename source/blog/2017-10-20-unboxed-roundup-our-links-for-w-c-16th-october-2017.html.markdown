So, it's finally happened. Software writing software. I think this has profound
implications for how we understand software and computers and raises questions
bout the nature of our interactions with it. If software can replicate itself

software and artificial superintelligence? Is superintelligence something that
can be owned? We live in exciting times!

ongoing maintenance problems with it.  This article explains some of the
prerequisites you should meet before trying to do this.  I think much of the
advice would also apply if you were embarking on a brand new application and
wanted to start with a microservices architecture.

https://krausefx.com/blog/ios-privacy-stealpassword-easily-get-the-users-apple-id-password-just-by-asking

Users are used to just entering their Apple ID and password whenever iOS prompts
them to do so. A phishing app can easily abuse this and randomly ask for your
credentials without you even having opened the app.
