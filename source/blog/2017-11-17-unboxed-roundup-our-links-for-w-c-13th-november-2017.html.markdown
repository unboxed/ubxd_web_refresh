## Who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their contributions - [Carrie B](/team#carrie-bedingfield)

https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/

From 200+ interviews looking at 250 attributes across 180 teams, Google
concluded that the magic formula of {n extroverts, n PhDs, n rockstart
engineers = successful team} didn't explain the variation between teams
that performed and those that didn't. What did? Feeling safe to take a
risk, being about to count on each other, clear goals, roles and execution,
working on something personally important and belief that the work matters
to others.

## Data viz extravaganza - [Lawrence R](/team#lawrence-richards)

How do you pick the best visual diagram to suit the data you are using? The
data viz project collects all the possible ways of visualising data in one
place â€“probably the most comprehensive catalogue I've seen. You can filter by
graph family, function, shape and input so it's easy to find a a similar style
to fit the type of data you're working with.

This is a nice little tool to sense-check your motivation when designing a
digital tool - A Manipulation Matrix from Nir Eyal.

## Time better spent - [Lawrence R](/team#lawrence-richards)

How do we design in, and think about, during the whole process of making
products and services, a more reasonable interaction between screens and
users? And who is best placed to be making those decisions? Whilst the idea
of ethics might be a little ideological, this website starts to think about
some nice reframing questions, particularly on the 'demand better design'
page, that product teams can use to start conversations about the likely end
result of the small decisions they make, often unconsciously, that affect how
someone interacts a feature.

## Yak shaving - [Murray S](/team#murray-steele)

http://yakshav.es/the-patron-saint-of-yakshaves/

This is the transcript of a talk about Donald Knuth's typesetting language
[TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX).  A language that may just be the
biggest [yak-shave](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving) of all time.

## Track of the Week - [Jolie L](/team#jolie-lanser)

My week has been about fire, our visiting friend from Germany got a phone call
 her house burned down and a few days later I almost did the same with ours..
 (No animals were harmed in the process, just veggies). I love this piano
 version of great balls of fire.
