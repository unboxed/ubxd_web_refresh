title: 4 types of prototyping to use when creating new digital products and services
---
Prototyping is a core activity when designing a new digital product or service. It’s also a key part of the [GDS Service Standard Alpha phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works) for creating new digital services within central government.<br/>

Starting with a problem to solve or a new idea, it can be very challenging to know what this might look like from an early stage, or how it might possibly function. Prototyping is a learning tool to begin forming ideas, assumptions and risks into something tangible. It’s a way of getting something into the hands of your users to hear their thoughts, receive feedback, learn and iterate, before repeating this cycle again and again; aiming to get one step further towards a potential solution after each testing cycle.<br/>

There are many different ways of prototyping, depending on what you’re looking to do, and it’s not always a linear process. Here are four types ofprototyping that you may consider using when creating a new digital product or service:<br/>
<br/>

# #1: Sketch prototyping
Sketch prototyping is just as it sounds — sketching out early ideas on paper to gather quick, early feedback. This is one of the lowest fidelity ways of prototyping, as well as one of the least expensive, but a very valuable stage as it allows for non-designers and key stakeholders to get directly involved.<br/>

Sketches don’t have to look perfect, by any means, the benefit is all in the low-effort input and high-value learning outputs. If you put a sketch in front of your user and their feedback is taking this into a different direction, simply scribble out what you’ve got, take this feedback and apply it to a next iteration of sketches.<br/>
<br/>

# #2: Paper prototyping
When you have a rough idea of the direction you might be heading in, grab yourself some more paper, a marker pen and a pair of scissors — it’s time to start mocking up early stage interfaces.<br/>



Paper prototyping allows you to take what you’ve learned from sketching and move this into a workable platform for your users to test further, as a physical “drag and drop”. By mocking up possible elements, this allows your users to begin experiencing individual interfaces, with example feedback possibly including:<br/>

- Moving a button or ‘Call to Action’ to a different location
- Changing the ordering of sections
- Rearranging selection options
- Introducing further features
- Disposing of unused features
