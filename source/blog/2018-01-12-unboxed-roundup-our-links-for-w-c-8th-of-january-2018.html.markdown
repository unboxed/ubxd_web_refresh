## The Seven Levels of Delegation - [Carrie B](/team#carrie-bedingfield)

https://medium.com/@jurgenappelo/the-7-levels-of-delegation-672ec2a48103

Self-organising sounds great (obviously, not to everyone) but in practice, the gap between a manager letting go of control and a team successfully picking it up is daunting for most people so here is quite a nice Medium article about one way to do that using Management 3.0 (YES there is a book and YES there is a shop with stuff to buy, but STILL). The method highlights 7 clear/tangible 'settings' between total authority and total delegation).

I wouldn't like to say how many times I've watched Star Wars the detail revealed in this article about the trench run is something I've never noticed before.  For me the article acted as a gentle reminder that it's always worth stepping back and evaluating your assumptions and checking that you've got the facts and details about something correct.

I suspect I might be the only Firefox torch-bearer here but if there are others; this is a very specific adjustment you can play with to make tabs for certain sites load a tiny bit faster.
