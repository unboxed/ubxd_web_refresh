## Fast JSON API serialization with Ruby on Rails - [Andrew W](/team#andrew-white)

https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/fast-json-api-serialization-with-ruby-on-rails-7c06578ad17f

Personally I've always preferred jBuilder templates over Active Model Serializers but the performance gains from this new gem from the team at NetFlix is probably going make me a convert.

## If Birds Left Tracks in the Sky, They'd Look Like This - [Tom S](/team#tom-sabin)

The title says it all, but in particular, the Starlings photo remind me of the machine war - Battle of Zion - from in the Matrix

## Terraforming 1Password - [Charlie E](/team#charlie-egan)

https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/01/25/terraforming-1password

I think Terraform's awesome, I'm also massively wedded to my 1Password accounts so it was nice to have all my favorite things brought together in this enjoyable blog post. I was pleasantly surprised at how simple their architecture was too.

## This is Service Design doing - [Boris D](/team#boris-divjak)

A follow up to a service design classic, the book that recently came out is accompanied by a website with a collection of service design methods available as a free download! We've also just received a copy of the book itself, which I very much look forward to reading in the following days.

## Easy to learn programming language for the Nintendo Switch - [Elena T](/team#elena-tanasoiu)

https://www.fuze.co.uk/nintendo-switch.html

It's becoming more apparent that the Nintendo Switch is here to stay. Even more so now that Nintendo have announced they're looking to extend the life of a Switch to 6 years. It's a promising new area and it's great to see new tools being developed for it. If you're curious about how to start developing for the Switch, there's a new language coming out in the second quarter of 2018 called Fuze. Seems to be packed with awesome features to help you setup your own game. 

## JS things I never knew existed - [Elena T](/team#elena-tanasoiu)

Did you know you can name `for` loops in Javascript and then refer back to them? I didn't. This article has fun examples of obscure things you can do in JS. Dazzle your friends with your new found JS party tricks.

## Track of the week - [Elena T](/team/#elena-tanasoiu)

Welcome the weekend with a feel good song! I've been humming this for a couple of days.
