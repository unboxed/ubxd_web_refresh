## Can you trust any third-party assets? - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://jakearchibald.com/2018/third-party-css-is-not-safe/

A week or so ago there was an article suggesting that a specially crafted CSS
file could act as a keylogger for passwords.  This article is a partial rebuttal
of that specific attack (it really only worked against frameworks that actually
put data in the `value` attribute of a password field, which browsers don't
usually do by default), but it goes on to explain that there are many things
that CSS can do that are potential attack vectors that don't rely on keylogging
or frameworks doing something unusual.  It comes down to wether or not you can
trust any CSS (or other assets) that you didn't create yourself.  You can
probably trust the CSS from a social media embed from a well known site, but
you almost certainly can't (or shouldn't) trust the random chunks of CSS that
might get included by an ad network.
