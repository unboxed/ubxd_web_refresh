## Amazon admits Alexa is creepily laughing at people and is working on a fix - [Elena T](/team#elena-tanasoiu)

It's not exactly an explanation as to why this happens, but confirming that people are indeed not crazy
when they hear Alexa talking to herself is a good first step.

It was supposed to offer a get rich quick scheme for everyone. Expect to see more of these articles cropping 
up as the honeymoon period for blockchain is thoroughly coming to an end.

I've spent some time thinking about what "senior" means in a job title
reently.  I'm pretty sure it's not just that when you've done ùêó number
of hours in the job you get to be called "senior", because I've certainly
worked with people early in their careers who were clearly senior in
everything but time-spent.  These two articles explore what "senior"
means without talking about time-spent and have given me lots
to think about.  Particularly around the things I'm not doing that I 
should be if I want to keep calling myself a "senior" developer.

This always puts a crazy smile on my face and is the accompanying song to the slo-mo (hilarious) video booth from my wedding.
