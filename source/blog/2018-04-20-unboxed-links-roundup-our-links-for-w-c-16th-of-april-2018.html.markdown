## Ways to think about and do stand ups better - [Carrie B](/team#carrie-bedingfield)

Choices, reflections, simple techniques - probably several worthwhile nuggets
even for an experienced stander-upper.

## Hex map of UK Parliament Petitions - [Andrew W](/team#andrew-white)

http://odileeds.org/projects/petitions/?216539

Petitions are back in the news and our [own
map](http://petitionmap.unboxedconsulting.com/?petition=216539&area=uk) has been
widely used but there's an alternative way of looking at things with a new
hexagon map that helps to visualize actual numbers better by reducing the effect
of large, sparsely populated constituencies.

## Beyond Markdown - [Andrew W](/team#andrew-white)

https://talk.commonmark.org/t/beyond-markdown/2787

Markdown has been around for nearly 15 years now and there's a new proposal from
one of the maintainers of CommonMark that it's time to remove some of the
ambiguities with John Gruber's initial implementation. The ideas seem to be
pretty sensible and should hope make parsers and renderers faster and easier to
implement.

Privacy is hard, but apparently not when it comes to your own trash.

## Track of the Week - [Ben L](https://twitter.com/benlovell)

It’s a remix of Sia’s Elastic Heart by Clams Casino. I chose this specifically
as I love the original, but this one is even better. I’m really into Clams
Casino’s sound, just so chilled and summery. ☀️
