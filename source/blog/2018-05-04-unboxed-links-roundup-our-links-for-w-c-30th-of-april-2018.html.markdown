## Actual "what is good" code research - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://brains-on-code.github.io/shorter-identifier-names.pdf

I'm used to seeing papers about better graph algorithms, or database indexing
techniques, or declarative programming implementations, but not so much on how

reckon".  It's nice to see someone do some actual research on the topic.  It 
may be on the seemingly simple problem of what sorts of names to use for
variables, but we have to start somewhere.
