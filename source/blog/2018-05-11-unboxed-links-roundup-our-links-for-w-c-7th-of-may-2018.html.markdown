## What happens if you get teams to self select? - [Carrie B](/people#carrie-bedingfield)
   
https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/11/self-selection-teams
   
Nice piece about an experiment based on the belief that self-organizing 
into small, cross-functional team is the fastest and most efficient 
way to form stable teams and that people are at their happiest and 
most productive if they can choose what they work on and who they 
work with.

When a major service platform has a problem, it can be a stressful time if you
happen to be using that platform.  If you're not using you'd think it would be
time to enjoy some delicious schadenfreude at the expense of all those people
who called you an idiot for not using it.  However, as this article shows, just
because you don't directly use a platform it doesn't mean you won't be affected
by it when it has problems if you have customers that do use it.
