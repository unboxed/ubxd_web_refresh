## Saying goodbye to websites - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://missyou.rip/

This site is a collection of "I miss you" letters to websites that have gone
away.  We often think that "the web never forgets", but at the same time it's
not hard to think of sites that have gone away.  It's important to remember that
these sites aren't just a [step on the incredible journey of the startup
founders](https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com/), but they can mean a lot to
the users.  When you shut something down, it's worth thinking about how you do
it, and what, if anything, you can leave as an artefact for those users.  The
gold standard to me, is what [ThisIsMyJam](https://www.thisismyjam.com/) did -
a static archive of everything.

retrospectives.  If you haven't done a retro in a while or were looking for a
few fresh ideas have a quick read of Steve's article.

## Track of the Week - [Piotr J](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaworskipiotr)

Why did I choose it? Well, I moved to London 2 weeks ago and during this time,
all the time, there’s beautiful weather, sun is shinning (yes, that’s true,
ZERO rain), a perfect conditions to do something awesome in this beautiful city!
