### The power of doing nothing at all - [Boris D](/people#boris-divjak)

https://medium.com/swlh/the-power-of-doing-nothing-at-all-73eeea488b8b

We've grown to subconsciously measure a person's worth based off how many hours
they work, how much is on their plate and put simply — whether or not they are
running around like a chicken with their head cut off. It's time to rethink
that! Give your brain space to think by stepping away from the daily grind and
doing nothing. Your mind will have time to stumble upon new ideas and further
process old ones.

## Track of the Week - [Andrew W](/people#andrew-white)

A bit of Kraftwerk in honour of the closing stages of the Tour de France this

winning again and with three huge mountains to climb and a fast descent to the
finish there's lots of opportunities.
