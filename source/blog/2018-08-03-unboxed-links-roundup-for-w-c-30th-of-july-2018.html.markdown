## What is programming? - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://www.theincomparable.com/robot/136/

This podcast started out as a discussion of what exactly was or was not a robot
according a strict definition set out by one of the hosts.  It's since exhausted
that topic and moved onto exploring other canonical definitions of things
like [sandwiches](https://www.theincomparable.com/robot/102/), or 
[holidays](https://www.theincomparable.com/robot/126/), or
[even death](https://www.theincomparable.com/robot/120/)!  In this episode
they try to define what programming is.  It's a topic that could easily descend 
into gatekeeperism by sneering at different ways of creating software (e.g. 
"You're not a _real_ programmer if you don't ‚Ä¶"), but luckily for us it manages 
to avoid that.  In the latter half of the episode they talk about visual 
programming environments like [workflow](https://workflow.is/) or 
[scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).  These are a way of programming that's 
completely alien to me and my day-to-day work in a text editor, but just because
you don't have to type out code, doesn't mean it's not programming or is somehow 
a lesser discipline because of it.  In many ways it might be better; no more
frustrating hours spent chasing down errors caused by missing semi-colons!

## How to encrypt your entire life in less than an¬†hour - [Ben B](/people#ben-baumann)

https://medium.freecodecamp.org/tor-signal-and-beyond-a-law-abiding-citizens-guide-to-privacy-1a593f2104c3

‚ÄúOnly the paranoid survive.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAndy¬†Grove
This 5 minute blog takes you through how to protect yourself by securing your online 
privacy (or to cover your tracks üòâ) Mark Zuckerberg once used the password ‚Äúdadada‚Äù 
on his LinkedIn account and was exposed when hackers released 117 million 
email-password combinations, finding his name among them‚Ä¶ Hackers were then able to 
use his email and password to gain access to his Twitter and Pinterest accounts üò±. 
No one is safe! So if you want some quick handy tips and tricks to maintain a safe 
digital profile then look no further.

## Try Crystal this afternoon - [Richard S](/people#richard-stobart)

https://gist.github.com/paulcsmith/5668e9407179c14b77aaad5cb27938e2

TBH I only looked at it because it's called Crystal and I thought [he](https://twitter.com/haironfire907?lang=en) wrote it.  It seems 
like it's worth keeping an eye on.

## London Cycling Design Standards - [Henry T](/people#henry-turner)

https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/streets-toolkit#on-this-page-2

Published design systems, or manuals, or standards, seem to be getting increasingly 
popular. I enjoyed reading TfL's design guide for cycling infrastructure partly because 
\I like cycling, and partly because it wasn't a guide related to producing a web service.

## Design checklist - [Richard S](/people#richard-stobart)

It's worth having a look at your existing site with a critical eye and seeing whether 
this checklist gives you any inspiration.  Horses for courses, of course.

## Compare passports - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

A very handy tool for comparing the power of different passports around the world. 

## Track of the Week - [Tim H](/people#tim-higgins)

We're going back in time this week as a result of my recent Netflix Mad Men binge in the 
coolness of my dark living room (I don't like hot weather). They wrote some good tunes 
back then, including this one.. enjoy!
