## Bugs as a security _feature_ - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.00659.pdf

Security holes in a piece of software are more often than not caused by an
attacker exploiting some bug that causes the system to behave in exciting and 
unexpected ways.  The attacker then leverages this behaviour all the way up to 
getting root access via memory corruption or whatever, and then you've lost your
server to some nefarious black hat hacker.  A lot of security focus obviously 
goes on how to reduce bugs in your software.  This academic paper instead 
suggests adding lots and lots of on purpose bugs that are not exploitable to act
as "chaff".  The theory being that increasing the bug count of your software 
means it takes the attacker longer and longer to probe for exploitable bugs as 
they waste time attempting to exploit your "chaff" bugs, which are, by design,
not exploitable.  Of course, these chaff bugs are added by software so you've 
got to hope that there's no bugs in _that_ software meaning the bugs you're 
adding that you think aren't exploitable actually _are_ exploitable.

## Useful Product/Project Roadmaps - [Matt T](/people#matt-turrell)

When working on projects of scale, stakeholders often request a roadmap so that 
they can understand how the service will develop and where it will go in the 
future.

All too often, what people actually want is an absolute list of what will be 
developed next and when, shown as a timeline.

Despite assurances that dates won't be taken as definitive milestones, invariably 
as soon as it's in black and white, that's exactly what happens.

When you're delivering an agile project, particularly for a new product or service, 
change is an integral (and essential) part of the journey. You cannot say in a 
year's time exactly what you will have delivered.

This article presents an excellent model to use for generating and visualising a 
product roadmap, encapsulating possible scope, rough timescales and a clever work 
in progress limits (simulating team throughput).

I'll be using it on a project I'm working on in the coming weeks.

## The Beauty of No Man's Sky - [James C](/people#james-cook)

https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/928mhp/taken_from_the_moon_of_my_first_planet/

I've recently got into a game called No Man's Sky since they released their latest 
update titled NEXT. It is a [procedurally generated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation) universe, and if you were to visit 
every planet in this universe for 1 second and you could somehow magically transport 
yourself to the next planet, it would take you 580 BILLION years to explore the entire 
game. The link I've included is to a screenshot posted on Reddit. This screenshot was 
taken using the in-game camera mode, which allows you to float freely in the game world, 
alter camera settings and apply filters to any screenshot you take. Yes, the screenshot 
you see is an in-game screenshot. 
So far, some of the in-game screenshots posted by players around the world have been 
incredible and they showcase what an amazing game this has become.

## Blockchain before it was cool in the NYT - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5nzx4/what-was-the-first-blockchain

Satoshi Nakamoto was inspired to write the whitepaper on blockchain by a 
timestamping service system. This was created by Haber and Stornetta. It was called 
Surety and it provided a cryptographic seal for a document by producing a hash of 
that document. 

However, instead of publishing the hash to a public digital ledger, it would be 
published in the New York Times.
