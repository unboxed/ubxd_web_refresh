## Upgrading GitHub from Rails 3.2 to 5.2 - [Andrew W](/people#andrew-white)

https://githubengineering.com/upgrading-github-from-rails-3-2-to-5-2/

Rails Core Team member, Eileen Uchitelle, explains how she and her colleagues 
took GitHub from Rails 3.2 to Rails 5.2 over a period of 18 months and offers 
tips on how to stay current and to smooth the upgrade process.

## Implementing impersonation - [Andrew W](/people#andrew-white)

The recent leak of 90m user records by Facebook was caused by a feature that 
allowed user impersonation. Jamie Lawrence explains how to implement this 
feature inside your Rails app securely and what pitfalls to avoid.

## Making video games more accessible for blind people - [Celia C](/people/celia-collins)

It may seem surprising but blind people play video games using cues from the 
game itself like the commentary or certain rumbles the controller makes. When 
an accessibility lead found out, she pushed for changes in the games to help 
them further. This is really cool.

When you think of CORS, you think of a security mechanism added for your own 
protection. However, CORS is actually a mechanism for weakening that protection
and we usually only interact with it when we're trying to bypass it. 

## Better code search - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

Work with me on a project long enough and you'll probably hear me bemoaning the
search functionality on github.  It can't search for punctuation, which seems
like a huge miss-step when searching through code as punctuation is very 
imoportant to the meaning.  However, maybe I'm thinking about improving search 
wrong.  Over at github they've started an experiment to allow for searching code
snippets by semantic intent, rather than by actual content.  It's a neat idea 
and I'm keen to see where they take it.
