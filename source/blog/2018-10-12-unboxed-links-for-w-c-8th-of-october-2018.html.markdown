## A minecraft scam gets out of hand - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://www.wired.com/story/mirai-botnet-minecraft-scam-brought-down-the-internet/

The [first ever computer worm][morris-worm] had a mistake in it that caused it 
to rampage much quicker and further than intended, and it seems this large-scale 
attack from 2016 had the same problem.  The authors intended it as a specific
attack with a specific goal, but it had a much further reaching impact.

## A debugging rule - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

Debugging is a hard skill to develop, even moreso because you usually only get
the opportunity to practice it when something real has gone wrong.  My favourite
advice is "read the error message carefully and start there" - I'm often guilty
of assuming the problem is something else and ignoring what the computer is
telling me.  The advice in this article helps avoid another problem - assuming
that the problem isn't yours.

## Track of the Week - [Neil vB](/people#neil-van-beinum)

One of the current Unboxed projects is around data management. This 
field often refers to the concept of a 'golden record', which is a data record
compiled from multiple sets to give the most accurate and up to date information.
When I Googled this for the first time I found out that NASA glued an actual golden record
to the Voyager spacecraft launched the 1970s which included a bunch of sound samples from 
Earth. Here's a sample of what's on it!
