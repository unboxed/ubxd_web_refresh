Artificial Intelligence has been around for a long time and smart devices, self-driving cars, and even robots are now quickly 
becoming part of our everyday environment. This has a profound effect on how we approach the design of new products and services. 
Implications go far beyond reimagining how we communicate with technology, raising questions about ethics of AI-powered decisions 
or about the meaning of human labour.

The [Service Design Global Conference](https://www.service-design-network.org/sdgc/2018) that took place in October 2018 in Dublin 
fully embraced this new reality and offered a distinct service design perspective to this fascinating topic.

# Designing for AI is designing for trust

A need for designers to rethink their role in a world of smart services and artificial intelligence was outlined by Lorna Ross from 
Fjord in the very first keynote of the conference. Designing for AI will shift the focus from making technology that humans can 
easily understand to making technology that can understand humans. This subtle shift will bring new challenges for designers such 
as issues related to trust, privacy, truth, security or identity. In an artificially intelligent world humans can no longer be fully 
in control of every interaction. It is essential that these new services are designed in a way that reassures users and enables them 
to trust decisions made by intelligent algorithms.

[TTC Labs](https://www.ttclabs.net/), initiated by Facebook, offers a handy toolkit with interaction patterns that make it easier to design new data-driven 
digital services.

# AI inspires a range of new toolkits, approaches, and ethical considerations

Wanting to find out more about what other designers are doing with AI, I decided to join two workshops. Both introduced new toolkits 
designed specifically for innovation of services infused with artificial intelligence. In each case we were asked to design a service 
that included new interactions augmented by intelligent components. I found sets of cards that represent possible and channels and 
use cases for AI very helpful as they guided the thinking in the group in directions that we would not have thought of otherwise.

Ethical questions raised by AI were emphasised in both workshops. Facilitators invited us to consider possible biases in decisions 
made by intelligent systems as well as wider societal implications. What happens if there is a security breach? Can we prevent 
autonomous intelligent systems from making undesirable decisions? What about information bubbles? Our society is already heavily 
influenced by information flows controlled by AI (e.g. social media feeds) and service designers could take a more active role in 
mitigating potential negative effects of intelligent services in the future.

# AI can enhance human potential

While there are possible negative effects and important ethical considerations related to the rise of AI, Stefan Moritz reminded 
everyone of its incredible potential to improve our lives. It should be easy to see the benefits of having robots do the work for 
us, as long as services are designed primarily around humans rather than around technological possibilities. We need to shift the 
focus from digitisation to humanisation of services. We can use AI to design services that are built with an understanding of what 
matters to people. Services that connect rather than divide, and that provide us with space to learn, grow, and fulfil our potential. 

In order to humanise services, we will require a shift in how organisations approach innovation. As Lorna Ross put it in her opening 
keynote: “Generally, organisations put a lot of energy into exploring the future of technology and very little into exploring the 
future of humans.” Service designers can turn this around and use artificial intelligence to design a better future for humans.
