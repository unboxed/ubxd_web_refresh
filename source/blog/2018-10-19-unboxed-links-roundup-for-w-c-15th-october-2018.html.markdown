## Google Pixel 3 review - [Murray S](/team#murray-steele)

https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mathonan/google-pixel-3-review-android

A review of the latest pixel phone from Google.  I wouldn't normally link to

## What does a senior engineer do? - [Murray S](/team#murray-steele)

https://jvns.ca/blog/senior-engineer/

It's important to note that a "senior engineer" is a title with no clear
definition.  Depending on your company, it might be the 2nd step up a very long
ladder that goes all the way up to CTO, or it might be the top of a short
ladder.  Regardless, this blog post by [Julia Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk)
explores what kinds of work someone with that title could be expected to do.
What I enjoyed most is the focus on what _isn't_ part of the role.  The caveat
is, of course, that this is Julia's own take and it may be different for you in
your company and different again if you move job.  However, it's important to
understand that you can work out what you can and can't do, and what you should
and shouldn't be expected to do, regardless of what those things actually _are_.

## Track of the Week - [Holly B](/team#holly-brenan)

I've had this song on loop all week trying to eke out the last of the sunshine
and warm weather vibes for as long as I can. Also, it's been the perfect
soundtrack for the warm welcome I've had for my first week at Unboxed!
