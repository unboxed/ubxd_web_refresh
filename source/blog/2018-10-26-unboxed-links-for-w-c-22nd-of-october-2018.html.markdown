## An extreme workflow - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864

We all know about the `red-green-refactor` TDD cycle where you start with a 
failing test, then you make it pass, then you refactor to make it nice.  There
are other workflows for development however, some of which are stricter than 
others.  This article suggests `test && commit || revert`; you can only commit 
code if the tests pass and if they don't you revert it back to the previous 
state and start again.  I doubt I'd want to do this, but it might be worth 
trying it as a constraint during a [code-retreat](https://www.coderetreat.org/) 
or other exercise as I'm sure doing it would teach me something.

## Learning too late from Anthony Bourdain - [Elena T](/people#elena-tanasoiu)

I've discovered that Netflix now has all the seasons of "Parts Unknown" with 
Anthony Bourdain. As I work my way through them, I ocassionally get a pang of 
sadness. This article kinda sums that up.
