## What are story points for? - [Murray S](/team#murray-steele)

https://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-real-story-behind-story-points

I have to confess that I'm not entirely sure I think story points are a useful
tool.  I've been in plenty of planning sessions where someone reasonably asks
"what is a story point" and is given the answer "they don't measure time or
effort, they measure complexity".  A long discussion usually ensues because
really what people want to know is when will something be done but they're being
told that the metrics we track don't measure that.  The failing here is strict
adherence to a story point dogma which is about as un-agile as you can get. I
wouldn't want to go back to "I guess this'll take 2 weeks" style estimation and
gantt charts, but neither do I think "it's a measure of complexity that doesn't
equate to time" is useful.  The article I've linked to above explores some of
the things we use story points for, and what alternatives we might be able to
use instead, including options for keeping story points, but being more flexible
about how you use them.

I'll be honest, I've fantasized about writing something like this myself.

## Github now allows you to delete issues - [Elena T](/team#elena-tanasoiu)

https://hub.packtpub.com/github-now-allows-repository-owners-to-delete-an-issue-curse-or-a-boon/

Github has made it possible to delete issues which has proven to be a
controversial move.  On the one hand, it doesn't help preserve the history of a
project. On the other hand, it means we can now get rid of issues like Rails'
'Bender from the future' issue: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/5239. Or
this one from VS Code: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32405.

An argument for why A.I. predictions severely underestimate replication of human
intelligence and why future A.I. might be potato quality.

## Track of the Week - [Boris D](/team#boris-divjak)

I’m going to see Leon Bridges live in a week, so I thought this would be a
perfect tune for this Friday.
