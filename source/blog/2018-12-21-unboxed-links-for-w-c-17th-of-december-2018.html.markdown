https://youtu.be/QKae1k1BDdA

I've always wondered how cheese started. I mean, why would anyone eat rotten
milk?

Writing software to identify song fingerprints is snow joke. If you're wondering
how Shazam can identify that particular Christmas song in your playlist, this

## Why do developers revere LISP - [Murray S](/team#murray-steele)

https://twobithistory.org/2018/10/14/lisp.html

LISP is one of those languages spoken of in hushed tones among some software
developers as the one true language.  It certainly has a pleasing simplicity
(everything is a list!), but it can't _just_ be that, can it?  This article
tries to explain some of the allure, and how we got there with LISP
specifically when there are plenty of other choices.

## Donald Knuth interview - [Murray S](/team#murray-steele)

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/science/donald-knuth-computers-algorithms-programming.html

A long interview and profile of Donald Knuth, author of ["The Art of Computer
Programming"](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html).  I'm still
in awe that when he saw a printed copy of his book he was so horrified by the
results, he created an entire new digital typesetting language to make sure it
looked better for the next print run.  A true yak-shave if ever there was one!
