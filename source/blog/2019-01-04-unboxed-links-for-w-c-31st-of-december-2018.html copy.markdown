## Migrating a Rails Application to AWS Fargate - [Oskar P](/people#oskar-pearson)

https://medium.com/code-wild/migrating-our-rails-application-to-aws-fargate-be671541b5df

How Bloom & Wild migrated their Rails application to AWS Fargate, allowing them to scale up their infrastructure for peak periods. Covers the overall AWS architecture chosen, and how they handled Logging and container load monitoring.

Disclaimer: I did a bunch of the above work with Bernat

## Ruby Quirks - [Murray S](/people#murray-steele)

https://idiosyncratic-ruby.com/

On this site Jan Lelis documents a bunch of quirks they've found with the ruby
language.  There are currently 66 of them, and while I've not read them all, I
am already learning things I didn't know.  For example, did you know you can
[use ruby as a replacement for `sed`][ruby-sed], or [even as a replacement for 
several other standard unix programs like `mv`, `chmod`, or `touch`][ruby-unix].  
There are also useful lists like the names of [all the global variables ruby
makes available to you][ruby-globals], or [all the standard library files with
some alternative implementations][ruby-stdlib].  This site is a veritable 
treasure trove of quirky things to find out about this wonderful programming
language.
