This explains how a text travels between phones. I didn't understand a lot of it and maybe skipped a bit, but I now really appreciate how complicated stuff is.

It's pretty common for most services to have some form of online chat these days, but the way in which it's implemented can make the difference from it being used or not – and therefore if customers are leaving or seeking information elsewhere. Some handy pointers here.

There was quite a bit of discussion at a lunch time chat at Unboxed week about how dishwashers work. This video explains the process in a very methodical way. I also like the focus on repairing rather than replacing that the video makers try to instil on the viewer.

A shocking interview with Ghana university professor Ọbádélé Kambon about
Gandhi, colonialism and racism. Very good read, specially if you watched the
movie.
