https://www.kennorton.com/essays/meetings-that-dont-suck.html

Google Venture’s Ken Norton is the latest to come up with a guide to making meeting bum less hard. He takes the ‘minimise meetings’ approach alongside the ‘fewer people the better' mantra. The complete list (including emojis) is here.

😴 Kill the status meeting <br>
👯‍♀️ Hold one-on-one meetings sacred <br>
📅 Every meeting must have a single owner <br>
📋 Share the purpose of the meeting and agenda ahead of time <br>
👑 Your calendar doesn’t make you important <br>
☔️ Calendars shouldn’t postpone decisions <br>
👥 Keep meetings small <br>
💸 Consider the opportunity cost of every meeting <br>
🌳 Treat other people’s calendars as a scare resource <br>
🚨 Escalate, don’t 🔪 undermine <br>
⌛️ If the meeting is over, end the meeting <br>
🔥 Declare calendar bankruptcy <br>
