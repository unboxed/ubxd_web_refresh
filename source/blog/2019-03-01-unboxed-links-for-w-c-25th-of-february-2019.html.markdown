## Paint the Picture, Not the Frame: How Browsers Provide Everything Users Need [NeilvB](/team#neil-van-beinum)

https://alistapart.com/article/paint-the-picture-not-the-frame

This article outlines some of the ways in which browsers themselves (as opposed to the web pages they render) can have parts of their design and functionality changed when web pages are visited, with reasons for why that's very often a bad idea. Some of these seem fairly obvious but either way it's interesting to learn some of the details about why that is. Whether it's adding a scroll-to-top button that obscures content beneath it, changing keyboard focus inappropriately, or styling highlight colours going against the user experience of other applications on the operating system, the recommendations here are to, at least, be very careful when altering the user's experience within the "frame" of the browser itself.
