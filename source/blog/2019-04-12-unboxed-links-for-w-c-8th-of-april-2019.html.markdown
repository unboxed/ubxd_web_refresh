Wasabi - [Holly B](/people#holly-brenan)

Literally everything you ever wanted to know about wasabi. Including finding out I've been eating it wrong all this time, although that's fine because apparently I've probably not actually been eating wasabi anyway.

Stack Overflow Insights - [Celia C](/people#celia-collins)

These are the results of a survey Stack Overflow conducted. They're really interesting both from a code-y perspective as well as a social one.

## Track of the Week - [Vicky P](/people#vicky-peel)
