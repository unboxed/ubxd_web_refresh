_Unboxed recently attended a roundtable discussion organised by HACT and the Chartered Institute of Housing. The session focused on why digital transformation seems to be struggling to gain traction in the sector compared to other public services and what changes in culture and leadership were needed to drive it forward. Attendees held quite diverse roles in different organisations and although the majority were not experienced in user centred service design as described by GDS manuals, a common theme throughout the discussion, expressed in various ways, was the need to put residents at the centre of what the sector does._

*Our short introduction to doing user interviews*

Out of this conversation we have put together a short guide for teams who are looking to get started and take their first step into taking a more user centred approach to project work. This introduction will look specifically at how to start doing user interviews, explaining the purpose of doing interviews, what’ll you’ll need to start and how to conduct the interviews to get the most out of them. Whilst just one part of user centred design process, doing interviews are a complex subject and we’ve tried to make the guide as straightforward as possible. We see it as a handy tool to bring with at interviews or discuss at meetings.

The guide is available to [view and download it here](http://bit.ly/-user-interview-guide).
