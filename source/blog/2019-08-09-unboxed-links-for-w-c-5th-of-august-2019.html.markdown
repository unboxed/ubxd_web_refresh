## Quiver for Mac - [Neil vB](/people#neil-van-beinum)

https://happenapps.com/#quiver

I've tried a few different note-taking apps to find the one I like best. This came out top. It has some nice features for developers, including easy conversion to code blocks in various languages, lots of keyboard shortcuts and ways of creating nested folders of notes.

I make many individual note files on things I learn which go into an uncategorised list. I use a coffee break each week to categorise, neaten up and consolidate the oldest 10 notes from that list. Going back over the notes in this way helps me remember the concepts they relate to. I want to keep building my own set of notes to search inside when I need to look something up. (A never ending task!)
