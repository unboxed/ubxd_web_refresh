## Jetbrains State of the Developer Ecosystem 2019 - [Oskar Pearson](/people#oskar-pearson)

https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2019/

Jetbrains does an annual review of the developer ecosystem, and uses it to publish some interesting information about the market. I found reading it interesting, since diving into some of the detail gets me out of the "filter bubble". It's interesting how some of the most talked-about and supported languages have small amounts of adoption and only small increases in adoption (eg: rust). I'm also interested in how almost all languages seem to have people planning to adopt/migrate: even Perl.
