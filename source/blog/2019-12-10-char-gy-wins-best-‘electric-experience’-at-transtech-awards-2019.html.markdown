The TRANStech Awards recognise imagination and innovation by those using technology to improve the transport system, rewarding excellence and achievement in both established and emerging areas of mobility and transport.\
\
char.gy has been successful in winning the Electric Experience award for showcasing the innovative use of technology to improve transport through its on-street lamppost and bollard charging solutions, supporting the uptake of electric vehicles.\
\
The full finalist and winners list [can be found here](http://landor.co.uk/transtech/thewinners.php).\
\
On the win, Richard Stobart, Founder & Director of char.gy and CEO of Unboxed, said:\
\
“The Electric Experience is the award that we are most-proud to win as char.gy takes a user-centred approach to delivering the full electric vehicle charging experience. Well done to the whole team for continuing excellence in focussing on the user experience of the product, putting our users’ needs at the very centre of what we’re doing.”\
\
A third of UK households have no off-street parking, a figure that rises to more than 60% in city and urban areas, and 78% in London. With widespread EV uptake being reliant on a viable, convenient means of on-street charging, availability of charging infrastructure is cited as one of the main reasons cited for people not switching to electric vehicles.\
\
Unboxed has been working with char.gy since 2016 to solve this problem, delivering physical lamppost and bollard charging solutions and a software platform for enabling drivers to manage charging via their smartphone. char.gy now has over 300 live chargepoints installed across Brent, Buckinghamshire, Redbridge, Southwark and Warwickshire.\
\
As well as providing lamppost and bollard charging, char.gy has [recently been awarded over £2.3 million](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/solar-high-speed-and-wifi-charging-set-to-revolutionise-electric-transport) by Department for Transport to develop deploy wireless charging technology on residential streets without the need for trailing cables and additional infrastructure.\
