On Thursday 14th March, [Melanie Martin](https://twitter.com/MelRheum) (Advanced Physiotherapy Practitioner in Rheumatology at Guy’s and St. Thomas, Topol Digital Fellow and NHSX Clinical Advisor) and I gave a talk at the [UX Healthcare 2020 online conference](https://uxhealthcare.co/). 

Our session for the conference focused on the MVP Remote Monitoring service that Unboxed has been working on with Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust.

Over the last 18 months, we’ve been working with their rheumatology team and patients to launch a new user-centred digital service to support patients with long-term conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, through engaging patients via SMS messaging to complete an online Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROM) form. 

Benefits of the service include the provision of high-quality, personalised care, without the need for patients to routinely attend unnecessary face-to-face appointments at the hospital.

Find out more about the project, including our approach, the outcomes, how it can be used to aid the in the COVID-19 recovery phase and the future of remote monitoring in the session recording:
