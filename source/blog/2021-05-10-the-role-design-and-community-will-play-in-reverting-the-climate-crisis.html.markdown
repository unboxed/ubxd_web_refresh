The primary challenge posed by climate change is the tension between the fact that when evaluating large scale impact - there’s very little measurable influence one individual’s actions can exert in the face of anti-climate legislation and corporate resource mismanagement – and the truth which is… Individuals (and SMEs) have the responsibility to do absolutely everything and anything that they can to minimize and reverse climate impact anyway.

# A Sparked Idea: Community and Environmental Legislation

 Tom is Unboxed’s Senior Delivery Manager. His role is to facilitate our agile teams and make sure that what needs to get done is done. Growing up in Hertfordshire, he displayed a keen interest in everything around him: nature, people, technology - the mechanisms behind how things work. From this interest, an awareness of environmental impact developed organically. “In the early 2000s, knowledge of CFCs destroying the ozone layer became mainstream knowledge through Children’s TV educationals and infographics.” He witnessed how the impact of widespread education leading to public pressure caused governments to ban the use of CFCs. Tom went on to study Environmental Geology at University and then worked in Public Sector IT for over 15 years before joining Unboxed.

“In 2008/9, the idea of Green IT took hold. We first began to realize just how detrimental the technology sector’s impact can be and so began exploring more energy efficient approaches.” Cloud computing offered a viable solution because it allowed for more energy efficient shared data centres, which represented a big win if they could be powered by renewable energy. Microsoft, Amazon and Google all now mainly power their data centres from renewable sources. In other organizations, however, the pivot to more environmentally friendly operating models can struggle to gain traction. “Most councils have declared climate emergencies, so the awareness is there but translating this into real-life decision-making processes is a hard slog.” Climate change from an organizational perspective is one of the most complex challenges we face: “what we learned is that we can’t just look at climate change as one problem that needs to be solved. That way of thinking makes it seem too big.” Rather, reverting climate change will involve tackling a myriad of smaller overlapping problems.

 “Starting small, starting local and then working your way up.” Tom joined a Design and Climate group dedicated to sharing learnings on how to solve small problems with wide reach while simultaneously creating the networks that will allow for the spread of these ideas. “Our design and climate group started as a small group of designers plus me and has grown into a slack channel of 77 people+ exchanging ideas and hosting climate-focused events.” He explains further: “tangible change will require political change, but political change will happen when people band together to demonstrate to politicians that climate friendly policies are a vote winner. Then comes the hard work of holding government accountable for those promises.” Communities start up as individuals bonding on the basis of shared interests or concerns and evolve into large groups capable of influencing large-scale decisions and legislation – they are a vital force for both change and accountability.

# Circular Economies: Tackling Climate Change with Empathy

Meanwhile in a suburban London home, a mother sings her daughter to sleep. A slip of light, she pauses at the doorway and wonders what the future will hold. Will her daughter be able to walk through lush-green natural parks, marvel at varieties of birds and swim in crystal-clear rivers as she had done growing up? She sits down at her desk and begins to unpack the problem in order to identify potential solutions: “we have a serious waste problem” she concludes. In rivers and oceans worldwide, plastic clogs waterways and channels disrupting natural ecosystems. Traditionally, business models have been derived from linear models of production and consumption: take, make and dispose. Circular Economy models offer an alternative: borrow, re-use, recycle.

Dawn is a User Researcher at Unboxed. Her role is to understand people, to walk in their shoes and to help provide insights that will allow for the design of products and services that meet their needs. She knows that the individual choices we make as consumers everyday do make a difference as ultimately all choices banned together are what influence supply and demand. But what she also understands, inherently, is that even for those who want to make environmentally friendly lifestyle changes, alternatives offered by circular models are often not accessible. “How might we redesign the life cycles of products and not just the products themselves so that waste doesn’t land up in rivers and oceans?” “How might we support the expansion of recycling infrastructure to meet customer’s expectations of convenience?” “How might we redesign the experiences and relationships between people and products so that people will be more mindful of what they consume?” 



Reframing problems through a user-centered approach is a powerful tool because it allows us to get to the heart of the problem through learning to ask the right questions instead of assuming the wrong answers. “By identifying the root cause(es) healing can happen from the ground up and by collaborating with users to determine potential solutions, these solutions will have a higher likelihood of successful long-term implementation.” She explains. “And long-term is how we need to be thinking if we are to solve the problem of climate change” adds Tom. Succeeding in reverting climate change is going to require redesigning everything from economic models to product labels. The humility required to learn from previous mistakes and the empathy fundamental to the design thinking process will be critical to ensuring this success.

# A Framework for Navigating Complexity: Environmental-Centred-Design

User-centred design has been revolutionary in that it has allowed us to develop win-win solutions to complex problems in ways that positively impact people's lives. However, taking a step back to strategically consider the big-picture problem of climate change requires us to extend the empathetic curiosity inherent within UCD one step further: who are the non-human stakeholders impacted by our product and service deliveries? Trees, bees, water sources, soil quality, even viruses and microbes... Of course, the more stakeholders brought into consideration, the more entangled and complex the web of interaction determining ultimate impact becomes. So the next question we find ourselves asking is: "how do we apply agility and transparency to processes influenced by a set of dependencies that are by their very nature not always visible, logical or chronological?"
