The primary challenge posed by climate change is the tension between the fact that when evaluating large scale impact - there’s very little measurable influence one individual’s actions can exert in the face of anti-climate legislation and corporate resource mismanagement – and the truth which is… Individuals (and SMEs) have the responsibility to do absolutely everything and anything that they can to minimize and reverse climate impact anyway.

 Tom is Unboxed’s Senior Delivery Manager. His role is to facilitate our agile teams and make sure that what needs to get done is done. Growing up in Hertfordshire, he displayed a keen interest in everything around him: nature, people, technology - the mechanisms behind how things work. From this interest, an awareness of environmental impact developed organically. “In the early 2000s, knowledge of CFCs destroying the ozone layer became mainstream knowledge through Children’s TV educationals and infographics.” He witnessed how the impact of widespread education leading to public pressure caused governments to ban the use of CFCs. Tom went on to study Environmental Geology at University and then worked in Public Sector IT for over 15 years before joining Unboxed.

 

“In 2008/9, the idea of Green IT took hold. We first began to realise just how detrimental the technology sector’s impact can be and so began exploring more energy efficient approaches.” Cloud computing offered a viable solution because it allowed for more energy efficient shared data centres, which represented a big win if they could be powered by renewable energy. Microsoft, Amazon and Google all now mainly power their data centres from renewable sources. In other organisations, however, the pivot to more environmentally friendly operating models can struggle to gain traction. “Most councils have declared climate emergencies, so the awareness is there but translating this into real-life decision-making processes is a hard slog.” Climate change from an organisational perspective is one of the most complex challenges we face: “what we learned is that we can’t just look at climate change as one problem that needs to be solved. That way of thinking makes it seem too big.” Rather, reverting climate change will involve tackling a myriad of smaller overlapping problems.



 “Starting small, starting local and then working your way up.” Tom joined a Design and Climate group dedicated to sharing learnings on how to solve small problems with wide reach while simultaneously creating the networks that will allow for the spread of these ideas. “Our design and climate group started as a small group of designers plus me and has grown into a slack channel of 77 people+ exchanging ideas and hosting climate-focused events.” He explains further: “tangible change will require political change, but political change will happen when people band together to demonstrate to politicians that climate friendly policies are a vote winner. Then comes the hard work of holding government accountable for those promises.” Communities start up as individuals bonding on the basis of shared interests or concerns and evolve into large groups capable of influencing large-scale decisions and legislation – they are a vital force for both change and accountability.
