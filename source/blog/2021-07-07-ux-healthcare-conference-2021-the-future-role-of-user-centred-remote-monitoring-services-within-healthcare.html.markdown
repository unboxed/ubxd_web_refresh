On Thursday 17th June, I gave a talk at the [UX Healthcare 2021 conference](https://uxhealthcare.co), an event focused on helping UX practitioners, clinicians and stakeholders improve the holistic patient experience.



My session this year focused on the future role of user-centred remote monitoring services within healthcare.

Unboxed has been working with Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust to create and deliver a user-centred digital remote monitoring service to help patients with long-term rheumatoid arthritis. The service has been launched and is currently being used by a group of patients.

Following on from last year’s talk, where [Melanie Martin and I discussed the user-centred approach to create the service](https://unboxed.co/blog/ux-healthcare-online-conference-2020/), the focus of this year’s talk was on how the service is evolving, and its role in the future of remote monitoring, including:



* Where the service currently is, being piloted by a group of patients
* How patient feedback is being implemented to improve the service
* Some of the challenges faced and overcome
* My own reflections and learning, including:
* The importance of getting stakeholder buy-in at all levels in the organisation
* Why designing your service alongside your product is critical
* How selling a process, not a product, is an effective approach

My full talk is available to watch here:
