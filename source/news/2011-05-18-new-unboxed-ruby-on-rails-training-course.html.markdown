<p>With Unboxed&rsquo;s extensive experience of developing in Ruby on Rails, we have launched a new Rails course on 11 &ndash; 15 July in London. Facilitated by one of our senior developers, this course is for web developers who are currently using HTML and CSS and want to venture into the world of Ruby. We think Ruby on Rails is the best way to develop websites and know that you will see why after coming to our course.</p>
