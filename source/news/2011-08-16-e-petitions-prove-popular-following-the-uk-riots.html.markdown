<p>The UK government recently launched the new <a href="http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/">e-petitions website</a> to give citizens a voice to petition the government online. &nbsp;By coinciding with the UK riots, the site received unprecedented hits with over 8000 petitions being created in 2 weeks and over 207,000 people signing a petition that <a href="http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/7337">convicted rioters should lose their benefits</a>.</p>

<p>Unboxed Consulting as part of the Agile Delivery Network (<a href="http://www.agiledelivery.net/">ADN</a>) built the new website in 5 weeks and provided the majority of the development resource. The site launched on 28 July with the functionality to create e-petitions and went fully live on 5 August once data had been published. With great interest in e-petitions, peak demand was over 5,000 users per minute and&nbsp;the team had to work with the hosting providers to resolve a few issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>e-petitions is a hot topic and received wide media coverage at the launch with the BBC Breakfast News mentioning it every 30 minutes. &nbsp;It gives UK citizens a voice and makes government more accessible. &nbsp;Commons Leader Sir George Young said it was a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8669763/Popular-e-petitions-will-now-be-debated-in-Parliament">&lsquo;step towards a more accessible and transparent&rsquo;</a> Parliament and campaigns backed by 100,000 signatures would trigger consideration for debate in Parliament.</p>

<p><font class="Apple-style-span" size="3"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px; ">2160 petitions are currently active with sometimes directly opposing views such as 23,010 supporting the <a href="http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/1090">petition to retain the ban on capital punishment</a> and 15,596 who want to <a href="http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/138">restore capital punishment.</a></span></font></p>
