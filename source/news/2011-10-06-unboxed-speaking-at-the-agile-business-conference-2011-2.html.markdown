<p class="p1">The Agile Business Conference is a major European Agile conference providing a single forum to explore the effective implementation of Agile methodologies. It was held in London from 4 &ndash; 6 Oct 2011 and Unboxed Consulting&rsquo;s Matt Frank, a senior Agile consultant, presented on&nbsp;<em>The Path to Enlightenment: &lsquo;Being&rsquo; Agile Is More Important Than &lsquo;Doing&rsquo; Agile</em>.</p>

<p>The theme for this year&rsquo;s Agile Business Conference focused on the maturity and acceptability of Agile as evidenced by recent significant successes and developments across the public and private sectors. Matt&rsquo;s session&nbsp;examined what &#39;doing&#39; Agile in an organisation means and&nbsp;looked at a number of different Agile methods, technical disciplines, and behaviour patterns which result in the early and continuous delivery of working software.</p>
