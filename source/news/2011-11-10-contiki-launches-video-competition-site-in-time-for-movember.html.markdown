<p>Contiki, the global tours operator for 18-35 year olds has once again teamed up with Unboxed Consulting to launch two new sites: a video competition site and <a href="http://za.contiki.com/contikicares/">Contiki Cares</a>. The competition site engages travellers and encourages them to share activities though videos, photos and stories. Fellow travellers then choose and vote for the best entry. Fittingly <a href="http://contiki.co.uk/contests/movember-grow-mo-or-faux-mo">Movember</a> is the first competition and includes both real and faux mo&nbsp;entries (for the ladies)&nbsp;with the closing date of 10 December.</p>

<p>Unboxed were involved in all aspects of this competition site - from&nbsp;user experience,&nbsp;design, development to full testing. It involved social media integration, including customising the YouTube interface with Contiki&rsquo;s branding and style.</p>

<p>This follows on from the launch of <a href="http://za.contiki.com/contikicares/">Contiki Cares</a> which showcases Contiki&#39;s socially responsible projects. It features their partnership with the <a href="http://za.contiki.com/contikicares/mar-leaders">Mesoamerican Reef (MAR) Leadership Program</a>&nbsp;which supports young, local environmentalists as well as&nbsp;<a href="http://za.contiki.com/contikicares/oceana">Oceana</a>, an organisation dedicated to protecting and restoring oceans of the world.&nbsp;Unboxed Consulting created a microsite that included integration with&nbsp;YouTube,&nbsp;Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and other social media platforms to create a customised social media feed.</p>

<p>Both solutions were created to give Contiki&rsquo;s editors maximum flexibility through their content management system, providing them with the ability to fully customise blocks of HTML and CSS styled content.</p>
