<p>Travel company Contiki has launched a new competition site,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thiswaytoamazing.com/"><span class="s1">This Way to Amazing</span></a>! Developed by Unboxed Consulting in 5 weeks and launched on 15 Feb, the site received 54,526 unique visitors in the first week and achieved it&rsquo;s objective of engaging new visitors as 88.06% were first time visitors.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thiswaytoamazing.com/"><span class="s1">This Way to Amazing</span></a>&nbsp;combines&nbsp;YouTube content, Google Maps and Street View into this virtual game. Players log in with Facebook, then watch a series of clue videos and use Google Maps and Street View to find travellers in different European destinations. On the way, they are provided with hints and tips, as well as a compass device that helps point them in the right direction. If successful, they find the travellers, who are built into a custom panorama at the end locations.&nbsp;Andy Sanders, Head of Project Management at Contiki said: &lsquo;Unboxed Consulting managed to deliver a great product with little stress, on time and within budget.&nbsp; They really set the bar for future projects!&rsquo;</p>
