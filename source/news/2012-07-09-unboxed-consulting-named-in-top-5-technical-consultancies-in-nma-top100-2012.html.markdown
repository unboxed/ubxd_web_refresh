<p>Unboxed Consulting has been named one of the top technical consultancies in the <a href="http://top100.nma.co.uk/">2012 New Media Age Top100</a> list of the most respected and sophisticated agencies in digital media.&nbsp; This annual chart is the definitive guide to the UK&rsquo;s top 100 digital marketing, design &amp; build and technical agencies.</p>

<p>As one of the few Agile and Ruby on Rails-led companies, Unboxed Consulting stands unique among a host of more traditional digital agencies.</p>

<p><a href="/team#richard-stobart">Richard Stobart</a>, CEO at Unboxed Consulting said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been the &lsquo;Agile Grown Ups&rsquo; for some time now and it&rsquo;s great that the industry is recognising this. Our creative approach and robust processes mean we are trusted with some of the most advanced digital initiatives in the UK, from complex Video on Demand integration programmes at Channel 5 to government applications such as e-petitions.</p>

<p>One of Unboxed Consulting&rsquo;s Ruby on Rails experts and organiser of LRUG (London Ruby Users Group), <a href="/team#murray-steele">Murray Steele</a> added, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting to see that we&rsquo;re the only Ruby on Rails provider in the list. Ruby is fast becoming the platform of choice for large scale, innovative applications, highlighted by the fact that government is embracing the platform. So it&rsquo;s exciting that we&rsquo;re now counted among the big traditional Java and PHP players.&rdquo;</p>
