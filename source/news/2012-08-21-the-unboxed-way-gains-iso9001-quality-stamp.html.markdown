<p>Unboxed Consulting is only the second Agile organisation to gain the rigorous ISO 9001 status for its development methodology. The ISO 9000 family of standards is a third party review of quality management designed to ensure that organisations meet the needs of their customers and other stakeholders (as well as any statutory and regulatory requirements).</p>

<p>The standard awarded applies to the entirety of the Unboxed process â€“ from onboarding new clients and projects, delivering the inception workshop, creating designs/wireframes, show and tell events and retrospectives. It even covers sales and marketing and the formalised client feedback process. </p>

<p>Unboxed Consulting&rsquo;s Elizabeth Curson says &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very pleased that our process has been granted ISO 9001 accreditation. We designed &ldquo;The Unboxed Way&ldquo; to be a robust and effective way to deliver an Agile project in a market where lots of companies say they &rsquo;do Agile&rsquo;, with little proof that their methods actually work. Now we can show the world that our Agile methodology meets international quality standards and how Agile is supposed to be done.&ldquo; </p>
