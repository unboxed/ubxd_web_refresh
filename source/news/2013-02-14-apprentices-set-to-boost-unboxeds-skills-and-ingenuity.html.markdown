<p>In February, five apprentices arrive at Unboxed Consulting.  We believe that for our size this is one of the largest SME apprentice programmes in a fast growth technology company in the UK. We are welcoming two junior testers and three juniors in sales, marketing and business management. </p>

<p>All are studying for a business administration qualification and will be spending one year with Unboxed Consulting. As well as learning and supporting The Unboxed Way in their respective roles, they will also be contributing their experience as Generation Y high-potential team members. Find out more about each of our apprentices below.</p>

<p>Luke Bennett: I went to a technology school where I focused on ICT and then again in college, so I am excited to start at Unboxed Consulting as a junior tester. I definitely feel Unboxed Consulting will have a lot to teach me and I am looking forward to learning a lot about ICT. I am enjoying the self-organised work environment as well as the friendly London atmosphere. </p>

<p>Abbie Ferguson: I did the MiddletonMurray pre-apprenticeship scheme and have now joined Unboxed Consulting to complete my NVQ in Business &amp; Administration. I am excited to be part of the team, especially in the marketing department.</p>

<p>Tillie McCarthy: I was previously working as an apprentice in a hair salon, however i didn&#39;t feel there was much opportunity for me in that career path. I then went on to doing a Pre-apprenticship Course at Middleton Murray where I was employed by Unboxed Consulting. I am very excited to be working with Unboxed Consulting and look forward to learning and progressing within the Sales Department. </p>

<p>Shirin Ullah: I did the pre-apprenticeship programme with Middleton Murray where I was trained for 4 weeks, completing a BTEC in Customer Service and Work Skills and I am now an apprentice who has been given the opportunity to join Unboxed Consulting as an Office Admin. I am excited to be working with Unboxed Consulting as this is a great opportunity to expand my knowledge and experience the world of work.</p>

<p>The apprentice team will bring richness and diversity to our vibrant team. Our ongoing growth means that they will be kept busy with interesting clients and projects. They will be sharing more of their journey and insights during their year with us.</p>

<p><a href="../team#richard-stobart">Richard Stobart</a>, our CEO said: &quot;The candidates were all of such a high quality and so enthusiastic that we wanted to take on more of them.  We believe that taking on apprentices will be beneficial to us, great for them and generally good for the country. Hopefully other companies will see the benefit we are getting and get onboard with the programme too.&quot;</p>
