5th July 2013 | 9.30am-5.30pm

If you're up against the Digital by Default deadline, this workshop will enable you to get fully up to speed with how to deliver your service digitally in line with the GDS service manual. Develop your approach, skills and methodology in our 1-day programme.

"Most services are starting in good time, but the approach they are taking is not fast and flexible enough to result in working software by the April 2014 deadline. This workshop will teach the robust and rapid development approach that enabled the e-petitions site to be fully built in 8 weeks flat for less than Â£80,000." Richard Stobart, Unboxed Consulting

This is a 'must attend' for all government services owners - you are warmly welcomed to join us on 28th June at a Central London location yet to be confirmed. This first workshop is limited to 12 service owners. There is no cost to attend.

How to apply:

-   Email <hello@unboxed.co> with a short summary of the digital product you need to develop and where you are currently in the process.
-   We will confirm your place by 21st June.

Many service owners are keen to have a conversation before this date. If you would like to do the same, please contact Don Cleeve on +44 78 0245 1165 or via <don.cleeve@unboxedconsulting.com> who will be happy to meet with you to talk through the specific challenges of your project.
