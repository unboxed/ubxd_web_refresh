<p>On Friday 5th July 2013, we welcomed a cohort of public sector leaders delivering to the Digital By Default deadline at our masterclass in central London. The event shared a strong methodology for rapidly developing digital products for government which is entirely aligned with the GDS Service Manual.</p>

<p>You can download the masterclass slides in full <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zukw0w2wgbpl3cs/Digital_Service_Workshop.pdf">here.</a></p>

<p>We are holding another session in early September - this time over two days to tackle the content in more detail. Just contact us to receive a personal invitation.</p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t catch it first time round, here is the PublicTechnology.net article called <a href="http://legacy.publictechnology.net/opinion/digital-default-doomed-default/37855">&#39;Doomed by Default&#39;</a> that <a href="/team#richard-stobart">Richard Stobart</a> contributed to earlier in July. Contrary to the title, he shared his thoughts on the robust and rapid development approach that <em>will</em> enable people to meet the deadline.</p>

<p>Many service owners are keen to have a conversation as well as - or in place of - attending the event. If you would like to do the same, please contact Don Cleeve: <a href="mailto:don.cleeve@unboxedconsulting.com">don.cleeve@unboxedconsulting.com</a> who will be happy to meet with you to talk through the specific challenges of your project. There is no cost for a first meeting with Unboxed Consulting.</p>
