<p>As broadband becomes ubiquitous and 88% of the UK population is regularly online, citizens are asking councils to explore digital services – and registering their disappointment with what is currently available. </p>

<p>The previous initiative to digitalise council services, Implementing Electronic Government, made many services available online – but did little to generate actual civic engagement or citizen digital engagement.</p>

<p>Now, the pace is picking up. There are 600+ services in most local governments which could and ultimately will be taken online as digital services. From parking fines to dog licenses, the scope is enormous. </p>

<p>The central government led <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/category/gds/">Government Digital Service</a> has clearly laid out the Agile roadmap for rapidly building digital products in the public sector in its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">Service Manual.</a> </p>
