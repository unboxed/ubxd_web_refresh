<p>The proposed 2014 and 2015 budget cut for local government have been widely criticised by local councils, though ministers insist that they will not affect frontline services. </p>

<p>So how will those efficiencies be made?</p>

<p>There is mounting evidence that digitalising internal processes and citizen-facing services is one way to create rapid efficiencies – whilst at the same time improving the process or end user experience. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Government">E-government</a> is not a new concept but becomes truly powerful through the Agile development approach– a rapid, end-user led approach to development which creates better digital products for a fraction of the cost and timeframe of the traditional ‘plan and scope in detail <i>then</i> build’ approach.</p>

<p>If the digital service under development is citizen-facing, it may well draw on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/assisted-digital/action-plan">Assisted Digital</a> – designed interactions and interfaces to get <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default">digital by default</a> services to the 18% of the population that are not online.</p>

<p><strong>Three ways digital services create cost savings</strong>
<ul class="bullet_list qualities">
  <li>Less labour intensive to achieve same outcome e.g. applying for a license</li> 
  <li>Higher compliance and more ‘right-first-time’ completions</li>
  <li>Fewer people required to check and enforce non-compliance</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>What&#39;s more - the expectation of citizens is growing:</strong>
