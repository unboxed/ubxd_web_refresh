<p>Unboxed Accelerated Agile Masterclass is specifically designed to accelerate experienced Agile practitioners to a new level. Led by Agile &#39;super-guru&#39; <a href="https://twitter.com/tastapod">Dan North</a>, it&#39;s particularly valuable for people who are frustrated with the pseudo-science of agile planning and estimation, the social pressure to automate where it doesn’t add any value, the artificial commitment of sprints and the unwelcome surprises that still derail their projects.</p>

<p>Using a mixture of discussion, instruction and exploration you will learn new techniques for development and testing, operations, automation and team dynamics, as well as working with legacy systems and integrating with third parties. Using these techniques you and your teams will deliver business solutions faster than they thought possible.</p>
