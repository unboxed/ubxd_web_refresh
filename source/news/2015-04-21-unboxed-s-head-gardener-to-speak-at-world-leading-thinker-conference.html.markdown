<p><i>“The conference theme is: ‘The Life of an Idea: Plant. Nourish. Harvest.’ my favourite analogy for the work I have chosen as People Gardener. I’m really looking forward to delivering ‘Climate change boosts growth of ideas that transform the world’. </p>

<p>My talk is based on how the world of work has changed. Ideating is what enables businesses to solve problems in new and innovative ways and there is a need to cultivate workspaces for Knowledge Workers who &quot;think for a living&quot;. Organisations need to adjust the climate to that in which the best talent can grow rather than expecting individuals to complete an obstacle course, aligning themselves with the way businesses expect them to behave.”</i><br/></p>
