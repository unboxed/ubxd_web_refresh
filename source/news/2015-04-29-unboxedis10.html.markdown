<p>Back in 2005, Unboxed was established from the sparkle in <a href="../people#richard-stobart">Richard Stobart</a>’s eye. Here&#39;s what he has to say about reaching the grand age of 10:<br/></p>

<p><i>&quot;A 10 year anniversary is an exciting milestone for any company.  It’s been an enjoyable ride.  We have nurtured people, delivered projects, found new customers, redefined the way we work, made profits, made losses, laughed, cried, and much, much more. We have become stronger with each year. </p>

<p>We are proud of our achievements and undaunted by our failures.  We seem to attract amazing people that have made us the company we are today and of those who have left us, the vast majority have gone on to do some great things.  We have had the benefit of partnering with some fantastic clients who have helped us become who we are today. We’re now looking to 2025 and excited about what the next 10 years have to hold.&quot;</i><br/></p>
