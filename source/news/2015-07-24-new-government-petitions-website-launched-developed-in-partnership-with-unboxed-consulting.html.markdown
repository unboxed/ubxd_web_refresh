<p>The government and House of Commons has just launched a brand new version of the popular <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk">Petitions</a> (previously named <a href="../product-stories/e-petitions">e-Petitions</a>) service where members of the public can petition the government and members of parliament on issues that matter to them. The service was redesigned and developed in partnership with a team from Unboxed Consulting. </p>

<p>This service is a critical part of e-citizen engagement and offers a unique opportunity for anyone in the UK to gather signatures of support for a specific issue, quickly and simply. It&#39;s part of creating a <i>&quot;new dialogue&quot;</i> with MPs and ministers. If a petition reaches 10,000 signatures, the government will offer a formal response, and if it reaches more than 100,000 signatures, it will be considered by the newly formed Petitions select committee, for a debate in the House of Commons. The new service is designed to make it as simple as possible to set up a petition - and to sign one about an issue deeply cared about.</p>

<p>This relaunched service is another great example of how the <a href="why-plcs-are-looking-to-government-for-digital-inspiration">UK government is leading the world</a> in digital product development.</p>
