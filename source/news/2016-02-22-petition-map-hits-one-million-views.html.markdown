Petition Map has experienced an increasing public demand during petitions with a high national following, such as:<br/>

- Introduce a tax on sugary drinks in the UK to improve our children's health
- Block Donald J Trump from UK entry
- Give the Meningitis B vaccine to ALL children, not just newborn babies

The map has also featured in a number of national online publications, including [Mail Online](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3352382/Three-people-SECOND-signing-petition-ban-Donald-Trump-Britain-hate-speech-claim-police-fear-lives-radicalised-London.html?ito=social-twitter_dailymailUK)

Petition Map is a heat map of the UK, which allows users to select from all live petitions (direct from [Parliament Petitions](https://petition.parliament.uk)) and generate a map visualisation based on petition popularity by constituency, using open source data. Users can also search through each constituency to find out the number of signatures on petitions in each individual area.<br/>

The map can be accessed directly from each live petition on the Parliament Petitions website:

We [worked with Government Digital Service](https://unboxed.co/product-stories/petitions/) last year to re-build the Petitions platform. Petition Map was built by our intern, Cale.<br/>
