We can reveal that we have secured our place on the new Digital Marketplace [Digital Outcomes and Specialists (DOS) Framework](https://digitalmarketplace.blog.gov.uk/2016/02/22/digital-outcomes-and-specialists-when-users-will-be-able-to-buy-and-sell-services/).<br/>

The framework is due to replace Digital Services and aims to open the market to organisations of all sizes to create a fairer marketplace. It is due to be launched in mid-April.<br/>

We have been listed under two Digital Outcomes and Specialists categories of service:<br/>

<b>1. Digital outcomes</b><br/>
Suppliers who can help research, test, design, build, release, iterate, support or retire a digital service.<br/>

<b>2. Digital specialists</b><br/>
Suppliers who can provide specialists to work on a service, programme or project.<br/>
