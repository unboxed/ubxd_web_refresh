title: Parliament Petitions hits milestone number of debates in House of Commons
---
The [Parliament Petitions](https://petition.parliament.uk/) platform has hit a milestone number of debates since its relaunch last July.<br/>

Over 25 petitions have crossed the 100,000 signature threshold to be considered for debated in the House of Commons, totalling over 5,300,000 individual signatures, with a further five petitions awaiting debate.<br/>

Examples of high-profile petitions to have passed the debate threshold include: ‘Block Donald J Trump from UK entry’, ‘Introduce a tax on sugary drinks in the UK to improve our children's health’, ‘Give the Meningitis B vaccine to ALL children, not just newborn babies’ and the more recent: ‘STOP CAMERON spending British taxpayers’ money on Pro-EU Referendum leaflets’.<br/>

If a petition reaches 10,000 signatures, the Government will offer a formal response, and if it reaches more than 100,000 signatures, it will be considered by the Petitions select committee for debate in the House of Commons.<br/>

Alongside these debated petitions are a further 210 to have received a Government response, having each individually reached 10,000 signatures, and a total of 10,070 petitions created in the 10 months since the launch.<br/>
