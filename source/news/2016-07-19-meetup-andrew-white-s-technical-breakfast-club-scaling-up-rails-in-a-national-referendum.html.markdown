  Meetup: Andrew White’s Technical Breakfast Club: Scaling up Rails in a
  national referendum
---
The time has come for the next installment of Andrew White’s Technical Breakfast Club.<br/>

The recent EU referendum saw the [Parliament Petitions](https://unboxed.co/product-stories/petitions) system process over 4.1 million signatures through the ‘EU Referendum Rules triggering a 2nd EU Referendum’ petition, in the days following the vote result.<br/>

Join us for this one-off meetup where [Andrew White](https://unboxed.co/team/#andrew-white), Rails Core Team Member and Unboxed CTO (as well as technical lead on the Petitions website), will share how a Rails application originally designed to process up to 12,000 signatures per hour coped with 150,000 – disproving the common misconception that “Rails can’t scale”.<br/>
<br/>
 
<b>Date:</b> Wednesday 31st August<br/>
<b>Time:</b> 09:30 – 10:30 (Breakfast from 09:00)<br/>
<b>Location:</b> Unboxed, 17 Blossom Street, London, E1 6PL<br/>
