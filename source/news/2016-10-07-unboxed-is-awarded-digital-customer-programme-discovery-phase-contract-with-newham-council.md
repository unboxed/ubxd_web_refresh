Newham Council is transforming the way they deliver their key services to 325,000 local residents, as well as making these services increasingly efficient for the council, through taking an innovative approach.<br/>

This Discovery Phase will see Newham Council partner with Unboxed, in line with the GDS Service Standard and over a 10-week period, to kickstart the first stages in meeting the user needs of local residents and building up a fuller understanding of what these residents require from the Digital Customer Programme.<br/>

Newham Council’s Programme Sponsor, Grainne Siggins, Director of Adult Services, said:<br/>

<i>“Our aspiration is to pioneer change by creating a resilient council and community that shapes Newham as a place where people choose to live, work and stay. We are transforming the way we work and how we deliver services that our residents say matter most to them. With their experience of successfully delivering Discovery Phases, we are excited to be working with Unboxed for our Digital Customer Programme, as the first step in our aim of reaching our vision of ‘Digital By Default’, while improving user experience and, ultimately, saving money.”</i><br/>

Martyn Evans, Head of Product at Unboxed, said:<br/>

<i>“We’re really looking forward to collaborating with the Newham Council team and supporting their first steps in this transformation programme. It’s fantastic to be involved in the early stages of this opportunity to provide better, and more efficient, digital services for the residents of Newham.”</i><br/>

We have previously delivered Discovery Phases with other public sector organisations, such as [Buckinghamshire County Council](https://unboxed.co/product-stories/bucks-cc) and [SH:24](https://unboxed.co/product-stories/sh24/).
