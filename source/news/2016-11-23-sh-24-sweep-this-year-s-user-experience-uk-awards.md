Online sexual health testing service, [SH:24](https://www.sh24.org.uk), swept this year’s [User Experience UK (UXUK) Awards](http://uxukawards.com), taking home not only two category awards but also the ceremony evening’s grand prize - Best User Experience.<br/>

The UXUK Awards recognise excellence in user-focused digital or service design, celebrating innovative UX offerings from organisations that take pride in offering the best possible online or joined-up experience.<br/>

SH:24 triumphed across the evening, taking home three of the 11 awards:<br/>

- <b>Best Innovation</b> for the most intelligent, ground-breaking innovation in building a service, app or website that is focused around customer/audience needs
- <b>Best Public Sector</b> for an app, website or service which presents information clearly, in an easy to access way and functions with good user experience within the public/government sector
- <b>Best User Experience</b> for the most inspiring, user-focused site, app or service

“SH:24 sets a new standard for public sector service design and is a deserved winner of the 2016 UXUK Best User Experience award. The UCD approach taken by the team has helped them provide a seamless experience across digital and physical channels.” - John Goodall, UXUK Moderator.<br/>

Originally developed in partnership with Unboxed, from inception through to Beta, a working service was delivered for the residents of Southwark and Lambeth. The SH:24 team have now successfully scaled up and rolled out the service to further UK locations, including Herefordshire, Shropshire, Telford & Wrekin.<br/>
