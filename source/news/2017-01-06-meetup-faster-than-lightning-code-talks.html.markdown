# What is ‘Faster than Lightning’?
‘Faster than Lightning’ is a series of very short and informal talks (around three minutes each), based around a snippet of code that you find interesting and/or conversation-worthy. Each talk is then followed by a casual discussion across the group.<br/>

The idea is to get to know what other developers have been thinking about and doing, with code sharing as a talking point.<br/>

There are no rules around what you can submit (although we do recommend keeping your submission to a single screen’s length in order to be able to present this clearly). Code snippets can be your code or someone else’s, in any programming language, and can be anonymised.<br/>

There is no such thing as a snippet that is “too simple” or “too basic” - it can be a snippet that you thought was good or something that you think could be improved. It can also be something you’re having trouble with and you would like help with.<br/>

Examples of past code snippets include:<br/>

- A Rails view partial
- An RSpec file
- C code with function pointers
- A puppet server configuration file
- A single line of Ruby code in IRB

… and many more. Other examples of previous sessions can be seen here:<br/>

Taking part is simple:<br/>

- Register for your place
- Submit a short snippet of code before the meetup to neil.van.beinum@unboxed.co or bring it with you on the day
- Chat about your snippet to the room for around 3+ minutes on the big screen - the order of submissions is random
- Open this up to group discussion
- Sit back, drink beer, eat pizza and enjoy the other submissions
