<br/>
Innovation can be a tough nut to crack if your organisation has a largely traditional mindset. Ideas for new market-changing products are what teams are striving towards delivering, but these very rarely gather enough momentum to be anything more than just great ideas.<br/>

Time, budget and effort are all used up but the big questions still remain: “What do our customers want from our next product offering?” and “How do we get this into their hands?”.<br/>

Join us on Wednesday 26th April for this one-off session, where leaders within innovation will share the tried-and-tested techniques behind their successful delivery of new product ideas, across both private and public sector organisations.<br/>
<br/>

# This event will uncover the techniques to:<br/>

- Introduce an innovative way of thinking and working into your department and organisation
- Form the basis of discovering what it is that your users want and need from your next product offering
- Test early stage product ideas to gather feedback and begin iterating these ideas further
- Engage your teams in the journey to your organisation's next big milestone
- Catch up with your competitors in the digital marketplace

<br/>

This event is for:<br/>

- Directors / Heads of Innovation and Change
- Directors of Product
- Directors / Heads of Digital
- Product Owners / Product Managers
