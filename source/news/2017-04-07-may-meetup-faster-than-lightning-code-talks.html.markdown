# What is ‘Faster than Lightning’?
Faster than Lightning is a series of very short and informal talks (approximately three minutes each), based around a snippet of code that you find interesting and/or conversation-worthy. Each talk is then followed by a casual group discussion.<br/>

The idea is about getting to know what other developers have been thinking about and doing, with code sharing as a talking point.<br/>

Here is Faster than Lightning in action:<br/>

Here's a bit more about submissions:<br/>

- Code snippets can be your code or someone else’s, in any programming language, and can be anonymised
- A workflow tip may take the form of a UI screenshot or terminal command of an app or tool that you use - it may even be something that irritates you and you’d like to hear about how other developers approach it
- There is no such thing as a snippet or tip that is too simple or too basic - you’ll be among a friendly bunch of developers of all different experience levels and specialisms
- Your snippet can be something that you thought was good or something that you think could be improved (or something you’re having trouble with and you would like help with)
- The order of submissions is random and we will keep having presenters until we run out or 8pm approaches - whichever is sooner

<br/>
Previous snippets include:<br/>

- A Rails view partial
- An RSpec file
- C code with function pointers
- A puppet server configuration file
- A single line of Ruby code in IRB

<br/>
… and many more. See some examples in blog posts of past events:<br/>
