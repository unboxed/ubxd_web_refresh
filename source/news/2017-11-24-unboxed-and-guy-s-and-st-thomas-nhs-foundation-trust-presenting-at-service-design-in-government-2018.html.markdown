Taking place in Edinburgh on the 7th, 8th and 9th of March 2018, Service Design in Government is a hands-on and practical service design conference, for anyone involved in designing or commissioning services across the public sector.<br/>

Martyn and Toby will be taking to the stage to present an exploratory and real life look at digital transformation and service redesign within the NHS, with a case study titled: ‘Sailing into the wind: service redesign within Guy's & St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust’.<br/>

As an insight into service redesign within one of London’s largest NHS Trusts, this case study looks into how Guy’s & St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust are working towards overcoming the day-to-day challenges faced by individual NHS departments today, and how they are already beginning to deliver improved services for their patients.<br/>
