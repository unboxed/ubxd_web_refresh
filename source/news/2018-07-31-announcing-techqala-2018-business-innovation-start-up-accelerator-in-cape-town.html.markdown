After taking a break last year, we’re delighted to announce that Unboxed will be running **Techqala** again this year.

## What is Techqala?

Techqala is part start-up accelerator, part innovation camp and part bonding experience. Based in Cape Town, it brings together local South African start-ups and international corporate innovators for an immersive week of learning and creative business thinking.

The days are loosely structured as follows:

* Early morning gathering for breakfast and conversation
* Workshops to explore concepts around Design Thinking, Lean Start-up and Agile principles
* Free time to apply the concepts to the start-up businesses
* Re-group to explore the learnings and socialise

With Cape Town specific activities thrown in such as a trip up Table Mountain or wine-tasting on a local wine farm, this really is an opportunity to escape the day job and explore some radical thinking.

## Why we do it

Launched in 2015 and further developed in 2016, Techqala was conceived of as a way to combine two of our passions - supporting purpose-led start-ups and driving innovation and change in large, complex organisations.

## Why you should join us

Whether a start-up founder or a an established  business leader, Techqala will give you:

* Inspiration and ideas to innovate and transform
* Techniques to adopt, adapt and share
* Space and time to think differently
* Lasting relationships with extraordinary people

Everyone who participates in Techqala has a transformational experience. Here are some of their stories.

> “Techqala was an extraordinary experience. Spending time with the team completely transformed the way we think about our services at Guy’s and St Thomas’. We are still developing ideas that came out of that week in Cape Town nearly two years later.”

> “Techqala deploys cutting edge start up methodology from Europe to the heart of South Africa - supporting real entrepreneurs as they start their companies via an exciting, energy-packed programme. It is the most rewarding and enjoyable week of my year.”

## The plan this year

As with everything at Unboxed, we take an agile approach - learning by doing, adapting as we go and iterating frequently. This year, we’re condensing the experience into 5 days from the 4th - 8th December - three intense learning days with a day at each end to travel, settle and relax. We’ve also decided to set a theme for 2018 - we’re focussing on sustainable health and wellbeing.

## What it costs

We don’t run Techqala for profit but we do like to cover costs.

If you work for an established organisation then you organise your flights and accommodation and make a contribution to cover costs (we suggest £300 per person)

If you are a start-up based in South Africa, as long as you’ve got somewhere to stay, there is nothing pay.

## Get involved

There are limited spaces so we have to be selective. Fill in the form and let us know why you want to come.
