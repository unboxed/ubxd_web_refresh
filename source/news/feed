    <title>Donald Trump block petition hits 400,000 signatures and rising</title>
    <summary type="html">A [petition to block the entry of Donald Trump](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/114003) to the UK has risen to a total of 400,000 signatures from members of the public on the government Petitions site, and rising every minute.&lt;br/&gt;

Built as a partnership between Unboxed and GDS (Government Digital Service), Petitions enables members of the public to create or sign petitions that ask for a change to the law or to government policy.&lt;br/&gt;

The Donald Trump block petition has passed the 100,000-signature threshold in less than 24 hours. Petitions that receive 10,000 signatures get a response from the government, and those that receive 100,000 signatures are considered for debate in Parliament.&lt;br/&gt;

The Government &lt;b&gt;will&lt;/b&gt; respond to this petition and Parliament &lt;b&gt;will&lt;/b&gt; consider it for debate.&lt;br/&gt;

Our [Petition Map](https://petitionmap.unboxedconsulting.com) shows a visual heat map of which individual areas are signing this petition from across the UK.&lt;br/&gt;

Coverage of the story has featured in major UK publications:&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Event: The £50k Springboard - How to use the first £50k of a digital product to build the business case for the next £500k</title>
    <summary type="html">&lt;b&gt;Date:&lt;/b&gt; Monday 30th November, 9:00am for 9.30am – 12.00pm&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Location:&lt;/b&gt; Adam House, 7-10 Adam Street, London, WC2N 6AA&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tickets:&lt;/b&gt; £95.00 + VAT&lt;br/&gt;

How do you prove the concept for a large, new digital product &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; unlock a full budget, with &lt;u&gt;just&lt;/u&gt; the first signed-off £50k… especially when you’re using Agile? Hear from those who have tried, tested and succeeded in doing so - Reed Learning,  SH:24 and BBC.&lt;br/&gt; 
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-50k-springboard-how-to-use-the-first-50k-of-a-digital-product-to-build-the-business-case-for-tickets-19361500770?ref=ebtn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/custombutton?eid=19361500770&quot; alt=&quot;Eventbrite - The £50k Springboard - How to use the first £50k of a digital product to build the business case for the next £500k&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;super_sub_heading&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Find out how to:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

• Build a business case for a new digital product or the overhaul of an existing one, using the first £50k as a springboard&lt;br/&gt;
• Structure the Agile phases of work to demonstrate value and unlock the rest of the budget&lt;br/&gt;
• Build trust with stakeholders at high risk product phases&lt;br/&gt;
• Communicate value, learning, risk and progress clearly to people unfamiliar with Agile&lt;br/&gt;
• Work with dev partners to nail the first phase to build trust&lt;br/&gt;
• Use the psychology of ‘the money’ to avoid classic Agile stakeholder pitfalls&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;super_sub_heading&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;This event is for those responsible for:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

• Getting a major new software application off the ground&lt;br/&gt;
• Or.. planning a major overhaul an existing online software product&lt;br/&gt;
• Creating the business case for a significant development budget&lt;br/?
• Defining the pathway from idea to creation of a large digital product or service&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Andrew White’s Technical Breakfast Club: Upgrading to Rails 5.0 - An overview</title>
    <summary type="html">With the impending release of Rails 5.0 likely to be the biggest release
for five years, it&#39;s time to start thinking about migration plans so that
you don&#39;t get left behind.&lt;br/&gt;

[Andrew White](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/andrew-white), Rails Core Team Member and Unboxed&#39;s CTO, is hosting this one-off meetup for &lt;b&gt;Developers&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Architects&lt;/b&gt;, covering how past major releases have tripped people up and what strategies you need to adopt to make sure your upgrade path is smooth.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Date:&lt;/b&gt; Wednesday 16th September&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Time:&lt;/b&gt; 09:30 – 10:30 (Breakfast from 09:00)&lt;br/&gt;

• What are the new features in Rails 5.0?&lt;br/&gt;
• What are the minimum requirements to run Rails 5.0?&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>New government Petitions website launched, developed in partnership with Unboxed Consulting </title>
    <summary type="html">The government and House of Commons has just launched a brand new version of the popular [Petitions](https://petition.parliament.uk) (previously named [e-Petitions](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/project-stories/e-petitions)) service where members of the public can petition the government and members of parliament on issues that matter to them. The service was redesigned and developed in partnership with a team from Unboxed Consulting. 

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bit.ly/1Iat6PV&quot; alt=&quot;Petitions launch&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
([Link to full BBC News article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33599604))

This service is a critical part of e-citizen engagement and offers a unique opportunity for anyone in the UK to gather signatures of support for a specific issue, quickly and simply. It&#39;s part of creating a &lt;i&gt;&quot;new dialogue&quot;&lt;/i&gt; with MPs and ministers. If a petition reaches 10,000 signatures, the government will offer a formal response, and if it reaches more than 100,000 signatures, it will be considered by the newly formed Petitions select committee, for a debate in the House of Commons. The new service is designed to make it as simple as possible to set up a petition - and to sign one about an issue deeply cared about.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bit.ly/1MhF54k&quot; alt=&quot;Petitions&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This re-launched service is another great example of how the [UK government is leading the world](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/news/why-plcs-are-looking-to-government-for-digital-inspiration) in digital product development.</summary>

    <title>Seminar: Rails 5 Upgrade – Advice for IT Leaders</title>
    <summary type="html">Rails 5 is due for release in August/September 2015 and is likely to fundamentally change the way we work with Rails.&lt;br/&gt;

Unboxed is hosting this unique event to allow IT leaders responsible for deciding and leading on upgrading a significant, existing Rails app to learn from the only [Rails Core Team Member](http://rubyonrails.org/core/) in the UK.&lt;br/&gt;

[Andrew White](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/andrew-white) will share the key upgrade issues for enterprise on:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Time:&lt;/b&gt;  09:30 - 12:30&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Date:&lt;/b&gt; Thursday 13th August&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Location:&lt;/b&gt; 17 Blossom Street, London, E1 6PL&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;super_sub_heading&quot;&gt;Who should attend?&lt;/h2&gt;
• &lt;b&gt;IT leaders&lt;/b&gt; who are responsible for deciding whether to upgrade a significant, existing Rails app to Rails 5&lt;br/&gt;
• ….and who are responsible for the success or failure of the transition!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(** note that we’ll run a detailed &lt;b&gt;technical&lt;/b&gt; meet up in September for senior developers and architects (Andrew will lead this too!)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;super_sub_heading&quot;&gt;Join this seminar to understand:&lt;/h2&gt;
•  The scope and scale of upgrading: &lt;b&gt;What&lt;/b&gt; will you gain? &lt;b&gt;How&lt;/b&gt; difficult will it be?&lt;br/&gt;
•  The business case for and against&lt;br/&gt;
•  Key pitfalls to avoid as the decision maker&lt;br/&gt;
•  The &lt;b&gt;best&lt;/b&gt; roadmap for upgrade&lt;br/&gt;
•  &lt;b&gt;How&lt;/b&gt; to steer and guide the team who will deliver the upgrade&lt;br/&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;h2 class=&quot;super_sub_heading&quot;&gt;Increase your pace of digital products and service development&lt;/h2&gt;

Tackling the topic of unblocking technology projects in travel companies, Richard uncovers the methods to unblocking a stuck project. Here’s a snippet of the guest post:&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Projects get stuck. It’s a fact of life whether you use agile or other methodologies to develop the applications that keep your travel business innovating.&lt;br&gt;

It’s not just individual applications either, if you have a large number of projects to work on, products or otherwise, sometimes it’s hard to even agree an order in which to start work...&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Unboxed turns 10</title>
    <summary type="html">Unboxed celebrates double figures this week as we’ve reached our 10th birthday!&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i1291.photobucket.com/albums/b548/grammccram/b6469f44-253b-4582-910c-b90c34d8797f_zpsvrjlivfw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image description&quot; height=&quot;117&quot; width=&quot;350&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Back in 2005, Unboxed was established from the sparkle in [Richard Stobart](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/richard-stobart)’s eye. Here&#39;s what he has to say about reaching the grand age of 10:&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&quot;A 10 year anniversary is an exciting milestone for any company.  It’s been an enjoyable ride.  We have nurtured people, delivered projects, found new customers, redefined the way we work, made profits, made losses, laughed, cried, and much, much more. We have become stronger with each year. 

We are proud of our achievements and undaunted by our failures.  We seem to attract amazing people that have made us the company we are today and of those who have left us, the vast majority have gone on to do some great things.  We have had the benefit of partnering with some fantastic clients who have helped us become who we are today. We’re now looking to 2025 and excited about what the next 10 years have to hold.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Our [anniversary song countdown blogpost](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/blog/unboxedis10-anniversary-song-countdown) reflected on the past, but we&#39;re focusing on the next 10 years and what&#39;s to come in digital. Introducing our &lt;i&gt;&#39;10 trends that will change the digital world in the next 10 years&#39;&lt;/i&gt; website, where we predict what will happened between now and 2025:

    <title>Unboxed’s Head Gardener to speak at world-leading thinker conference</title>
    <summary type="html">Unboxed Consulting&#39;s Head Gardener, [Claire Kemp](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/claire-kemp), has been confirmed to speak at this year’s TEDx SevenMileBeach conference in the Cayman Islands.&lt;br/&gt;

The conference, now in it&#39;s second year, will bring together 100 delegates, from all around the globe, for one day of exclusive talks on 10th June 2015. Claire will take to the stage to share her experiences with a selection of storytellers and visionaries from around the world.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i1291.photobucket.com/albums/b548/grammccram/Screen%20Shot%202015-04-21%20at%2016.41.47_zpsjjcafgn1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; width=&quot;527&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;“The conference theme is: ‘The Life of an Idea: Plant. Nourish. Harvest.’ my favourite analogy for the work I have chosen as People Gardener. I’m really looking forward to delivering ‘Climate change boosts growth of ideas that transform the world’. 

My talk is based on how the world of work has changed. Ideating is what enables businesses to solve problems in new and innovative ways and there is a need to cultivate workspaces for Knowledge Workers who &quot;think for a living&quot;. Organisations need to adjust the climate to that in which the best talent can grow rather than expecting individuals to complete an obstacle course, aligning themselves with the way businesses expect them to behave.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Digital Healthcare Roundtable</title>
    <summary type="html">Leaders from business, the NHS evangelists, charities and others will explore and debate how we can do more to improve public health with digital technology at our upcoming Digital Healthcare Roundtable.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;When:&lt;/b&gt; Wednesday 18th February, 16:00 – 18:00&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Where:&lt;/b&gt; 17 Blossom Street, London, E1 6PL&lt;br/&gt;

Healthcare innovation is advancing exponentially (from bionic eyes to lab grown bones).
Digital technology is too – but not in healthcare. Facebook, Twitter, Skype and Tindr have changed our lives so…&lt;br/&gt;

• Why is it still so difficult to book an appointment with my doctor?&lt;br/&gt;
• Why don’t I have an online record of my healthcare treatment?&lt;br/&gt;
• Why are so many UK citizens who try to manage their own health and wellbeing feeling isolated from the NHS?&lt;br/&gt;

![healthcare1](http://i1291.photobucket.com/albums/b548/grammccram/Screen%20Shot%202015-02-02%20at%2012.42.46_zpsqsnmoxgd.png)

We&#39;ll be hearing from health technology leaders:&lt;br/&gt;
• Kumar Jacob MBE - Principal Consultant, KJx&lt;br/&gt;
• Thomas Whicher - Founder,  DrDoctor&lt;br/&gt;
• Ian Drysdale - CTO, GoodGym&lt;br/&gt;

The format is simple - three presentations from within the group, followed by a single conversation around the table. The aim is to learn from each other and find better ways to use digital technology already available to us.&lt;br/&gt;</summary>

    <title>StrongerAgile Webinar Series 2015</title>
    <summary type="html">Help yourself to practical advice and tools from some of the most experienced Agile practitioners on the planet: Unboxed’s [Richard Stobart](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/richard-stobart), [Martyn Evans](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/martyn-evans), [Carlo Kruger](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/carlo-kruger) and [Steve Lennon](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/steve-lennon).

&lt;h2 class=&quot;super_sub_heading&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why pair programming? And how to do it well...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Wednesday 4th February, 16:00&lt;/h2&gt;
IBM reported spending about &lt;i&gt;“$250 million repairing and reinstalling fixes to 30,000 customer-reported problems”&lt;/i&gt; – money that would have been saved if they had used paired programming. Done well, it takes 15% more time but reduces code defects significantly. This webinar is for Product Owners, Product Managers, Business Analysts and developers who want to understand how to tap into the value of paired programming.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;• Why you want to do it&lt;br/&gt;
• What the quality benefits are&lt;br/&gt;
• The best way to pair&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;super_sub_heading&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spanning the rift - advice for waterfall organisations running Agile projects&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Wednesday 18th February, 16:00&lt;/h2&gt;
Agile was once considered by project management professionals to be a fad. As it matures, larger and more complex organisations are transitioning from a rich waterfall history to Agile, with some clunks along the way. If this is your challenge, this webinar will provide you with a toolkit to navigate the transition skillfully.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
• &lt;i&gt;&#39;Waterfall Agile’&lt;/i&gt; is NOT a good idea&lt;br/&gt;
• Creating an Agile introduction for waterfall organisations&lt;br/&gt;
• Taking Agile into waterfall &lt;i&gt;‘boardrooms’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;h2 class=&quot;super_sub_heading&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take developers up the foodchain: why and how to include developers in business and design meetings for better ideation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Wednesday 4th March, 16:00&lt;/h2&gt;
Discover why and how to bring IT people into the ideation process for a more powerful process and a faster route from ideas to market; or from features to users. Understand how to make this painfree and energising for everyone involved.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
• Developers have ideas too – how to understand and harness them without bringing ideation to a standstill&lt;br/&gt;
• How developers view features and complexity&lt;br/&gt;
• Managing developer disruption &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;h2 class=&quot;super_sub_heading&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Offshoring Agile: Make it work in practice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Wednesday 18th March, 16:00&lt;/h2&gt;
Despite the belief that [agile can’t work offshore](http://www.cio.com.au/article/547142/why_offshoring_agile_development_often_doesn_t_work/), it can flourish with the right mindset, processes and relationship. Hear from experts in Agile offshoring based in Cape Town, who will share a roadmap and toolkit for Agile success across geography.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
• The best way to do distributed development&lt;br/&gt;
• How we manage off-shore work, pitfalls&lt;br/&gt;
• Practical tips from our client projects between Cape Town and London&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Richard Stobart wins award for the best Agile Mentor at Agile Awards</title>
    <summary type="html">Unboxed Consulting CEO, Richard Stobart, has been named &lt;i&gt;Best Agile Coach or Mentor (Process)&lt;/i&gt; at the 2014 UK Agile Awards.&lt;br/&gt;

The win recognised the way in which Richard supported Plymouth University in the move to Agile, including the Agile development of a new external website.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Specifically Richard:&lt;br/&gt;
- Oriented the whole IT function towards Agile&lt;br/&gt;
- Ran a hugely popular training series and offered counselling and 1:1 mentoring&lt;br/&gt;
- Educated their executive board&lt;br/&gt;
- Provided them with a raft of techniques and tricks they can use every day&lt;br/&gt;
- Supported them in changing the way they work with suppliers, focusing on the value delivered not the services purchased and coached these suppliers too&lt;br/&gt;
- Spread the Agile approach to other non-IT university projects&lt;br/&gt;

Paul Westmore of Plymouth University says: &lt;i&gt;“Richard planted the seed in my mind four years ago that Agile could be the way to solve many of the IT challenges in the public sector. Richard’s role throughout our Agile journey gone far beyond ‘mentor’ and enabled us to achieve more than we could have imagined.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

On the win, Richard said:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“Working with Paul Westmore’s team at Plymouth University has been a very energising experience. They represent the fast-changing digital scene in the UK’s public sector and the move towards Agile. It’s fantastic.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Why PLCs are looking to government for digital inspiration</title>
    <summary type="html">Martha Lane-Fox challenged  the government to perform a &lt;i&gt;&quot;revolution not evolution&quot;&lt;/i&gt; of its digital services. It has risen to the challenge, saving hundreds of millions of pounds already and setting the bar for the corporates who previously outpaced them.&lt;br/&gt;

Richard Stobart of Unboxed Consulting says &lt;i&gt;&quot;For the first time, our enterprise customers are looking up to our government customers in the digital transformation space&quot;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

What does government know that corporates don&#39;t? Simple. Government knows that the world no longer accepts clunky digital products that don&#39;t deliver expected value. They treat the move to digital services as strategic transformation not pet projects. They focus obsessively on user needs. They work on culture not just code.&lt;br/&gt;

The Government Digital Service (GDS) has led the change, setting the digital service standard, change the way projects are led and financially controlled, hiring the best people and pioneering exemplar services.&lt;br/&gt;

GDS understands that the truly astronomical cost savings are captured, not on a shoestring, but by people who really know how to do agile. They&#39;re invested in training the civil service, acting as a consultancy, giving ready access to experts at a competitive price via g-cloud, providing a clear online &#39;handbook&#39; and working with SMEs - new, hungry talent.&lt;br/&gt;

Deliberate risk taking and transparent communication has reduced consequences of making an error, leading to rapid learning and huge cost reductions. What&#39;s more, their open standards approach allows sharing across organisations, multiplying their impact.&lt;br/&gt;

The US led the information age but the UK is leading the digital product age.</summary>

    <title>Distributed development teams fail… now learn ‘new rules’ direct from companies who have created smart, successful and distributed teams</title>
    <summary type="html">&lt;b&gt;9.30am - 12.30pm |  Wednesday 8th October  |  116-120 Goswell Road, London, EC1V 7DP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Digital products require empowered, multi-disciplinary teams work in the same &#39;space&#39; making decisions at the point they are needed. The options for constructing teams are diverse with many permutations of inhouse, outsourced and off/on/nearshoring. And products at different stages of the digital product lifecycle have different needs. 

Key issues: cost, risk, quality, sustainability, speed. No one model ticks all these boxes. So how do we make good choices?

The best companies in the world are creating new formations of teams and applying a common set of rules to enable them to succeed.

&lt;b&gt;Hear the ‘new rules’ from:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
- Paul Westmore – Director of IT, Plymouth University&lt;br/&gt;
- Yoann Martin – Technical Director, notonthehighstreet.com&lt;br/&gt;
- James Tatam - Digital Media Director, Channel 5&lt;br/&gt;
- Richard Stobart - CEO, Unboxed Consulting&lt;br/&gt;
- Steve Lennon - Project Delivery Manager, Unboxed Consulting&lt;br/&gt;

If you are thinking about how to grow your development team or how to get your next product delivered in the most effective way, then this event is for you.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Calling all:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
- Product Owners, Product Managers and Service Managers&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Unboxed Consulting to give talk session at UX Craft Cape Town South Africa</title>
    <summary type="html">[Carlo Kruger] (http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/carlo-kruger) of our Cape Town office is scheduled to give a talk at the inaugural UX South Africa Conference, taking place on 3rd &amp; 4th October in Cape Town.

This two-day conference aims to raise awareness around UX and business integration in South Africa, providing a mix of inspiration, education and skill development to UX practitioners. A full programme by some of the best practitioners in South Africa is currently being put together. 

&lt;i&gt;‘Product Management, Cognitive Bias and You’&lt;/i&gt; is the title of Carlo’s talk, taking place on Saturday 4th October. 

A short synopsis of the talk:
	
&lt;i&gt;Product development is hard. It might be one of the hardest things we’ve ever tried to do as a species. It seems like product success is all trial and error and luck (and pivoting, don’t forget pivoting). What doesn’t help is that we seem to have the deck stacked against us. We are all susceptible to our innate cognitive biases when making decisions. This session will identify some common cognitive biases and show their impact on how we make decisions in product management. And we’ll explore how User Centered Design can help us overcome these limitations.&lt;/i&gt;

More information about the UX South Africa Conference, and a list of other confirmed speakers, can be found on the [official website] (http://www.uxsouthafrica.com/#home).</summary>

    <title>MP’s broaden their knowledge of deafness</title>
    <summary type="html">A deaf employee from Unboxed Consulting spent the day at the House of Commons on Wednesday, May 14 to talk to Members of Parliament (MP’s) about what life is like as a deaf person in a hearing working world.

Unboxed Consulting was one of only four companies invited to participate in the event, which was organised in the lead up to support Deaf Awareness Week.

MP’s attended bite-sized training sessions to understand the impact of deafness on people in their constituency and improve communications skills.

The event was organised by HearFirst, a national award winning workplace training and consultancy company, to help improve MP’s understanding of the different types of deafness by highlighting the methods of communication used by deaf, deafened, deafblind and hard of hearing people, such as sign language and lipreading.

As part of organised activities, an employee from Unboxed Consulting who is deaf and working met MP’s to talk about their job, the contribution they make, the support they receive from their employer and what life is like as a deaf person in a hearing working world.

Over 25 MP’s attended the sessions and Jolie Lanser, Scrum Master from Unboxed Consulting, said: &quot;It was great to show that a little bit of support offers me so much more potential. I was pleased to hear Unboxed was an example for the MP’s on how to embrace disability at work.”

Julie Ryder, Director and Founder of HearFirst, said: “The aim of the event was to raise awareness of deafness and provide MP’s with the knowledge and skills to help them make real changes for Deaf people within their constituencies.

“In the case of MP’s, it could mean being deaf aware during one-to-one meetings with constituents, making more formal meetings accessible and considering the needs of BSL users in written or web based materials.  

“I am really pleased that a representative from Unboxed Consulting came along to support the event and spoke to MP’s at first-hand about real life experiences and the barriers and challenges that deaf people may experience in a working hearing environment.” 

Jake Berry MP for Rossendale and Darwen who championed the sessions, commented: “Taking part today has really helped me raise my awareness to the issues faced by people experiencing all types of deafness in my constituency.  It’s been great to take part and support Deaf Awareness Week.” 

Now in its eleventh year, Deaf Awareness Week is a week-long campaign between 19th and 25th May and is co-ordinated by the UK Council on Deafness (UKCoD).  Hundreds of deaf charities and organisations across the UK will participate in a series of national and local events during the week.</summary>

    <title>Local government: agile digital services for civic engagement</title>
    <summary type="html">As broadband becomes ubiquitous and 88% of the UK population is regularly online, citizens are asking councils to explore digital services – and registering their disappointment with what is currently available. 

The previous initiative to digitalise council services, Implementing Electronic Government, made many services available online – but did little to generate actual civic engagement or citizen digital engagement.

Now, the pace is picking up. There are 600+ services in most local governments which could and ultimately will be taken online as digital services. From parking fines to dog licenses, the scope is enormous. 

The central government led [Government Digital Service](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/category/gds/) has clearly laid out the Agile roadmap for rapidly building digital products in the public sector in its [Service Manual.](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual)

    <title>Local government: how agile development of digital services can help meet council budget cuts</title>
    <summary type="html">The proposed 2014 and 2015 budget cut for local government have been widely criticised by local councils, though ministers insist that they will not affect frontline services. 

So how will those efficiencies be made?

There is mounting evidence that digitalising internal processes and citizen-facing services is one way to create rapid efficiencies – whilst at the same time improving the process or end user experience. 

[E-government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Government) is not a new concept but becomes truly powerful through the Agile development approach– a rapid, end-user led approach to development which creates better digital products for a fraction of the cost and timeframe of the traditional ‘plan and scope in detail &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; build’ approach.

If the digital service under development is citizen-facing, it may well draw on [Assisted Digital](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/assisted-digital/action-plan.html) – designed interactions and interfaces to get [digital by default](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default) services to the 18% of the population that are not online.

**Three ways digital services create cost savings**
&lt;ul class=&quot;bullet_list qualities&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less labour intensive to achieve same outcome e.g. applying for a license&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Higher compliance and more ‘right-first-time’ completions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fewer people required to check and enforce non-compliance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

**What&#39;s more - the expectation of citizens is growing:**

    <title>Digital By Default masterclass - first cohort of public sector leaders explore Agile methodology to meet the deadline</title>
    <summary type="html">On Friday 5th July 2013, we welcomed a cohort of public sector leaders delivering to the Digital By Default deadline at our masterclass in central London. The event shared a strong methodology for rapidly developing digital products for government which is entirely aligned with the GDS Service Manual.

You can download the masterclass slides in full [here.] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/zukw0w2wgbpl3cs/Digital_Service_Workshop.pdf)

We are holding another session in early September - this time over two days to tackle the content in more detail. Just contact us to receive a personal invitation.

If you didn&#39;t catch it first time round, here is the PublicTechnology.net article called [&#39;Doomed by Default&#39;] (http://legacy.publictechnology.net/opinion/digital-default-doomed-default/37855) that [Richard Stobart](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/richard-stobart) contributed to earlier in July. Contrary to the title, he shared his thoughts on the robust and rapid development approach that *will* enable people to meet the deadline.

Many service owners are keen to have a conversation as well as - or in place of - attending the event. If you would like to do the same, please contact Don Cleeve: don.cleeve@unboxedconsulting.com who will be happy to meet with you to talk through the specific challenges of your project.

    <summary type="html">5th July 2013 | 9.30am-5.30pm 

If you&#39;re up against the Digital by Default deadline, this workshop will enable you to get fully up to speed with how to deliver your service digitally in line with the GDS service manual. Develop your approach, skills and methodology in our 1-day programme.

&quot;Most services are starting in good time, but the approach they are taking is not fast and flexible enough to result in working software by the April 2014 deadline. This workshop will teach the robust and rapid development approach that enabled the e-petitions site to be fully built in 8 weeks flat for less than £80,000.&quot; Richard Stobart, Unboxed Consulting

This is a &#39;must attend&#39; for all government services owners - you are warmly welcomed to join us on 28th June at a Central London location yet to be confirmed. This first workshop is limited to 12 service owners. There is no cost to attend.

    <title>Apprentices set to boost Unboxed&#39;s skills and ingenuity</title>
    <summary type="html">In February, five apprentices arrive at Unboxed Consulting.  We believe that for our size this is one of the largest SME apprentice programmes in a fast growth technology company in the UK. We are welcoming two junior testers and three juniors in sales, marketing and business management. 

All are studying for a business administration qualification and will be spending one year with Unboxed Consulting. As well as learning and supporting The Unboxed Way in their respective roles, they will also be contributing their experience as Generation Y high-potential team members. Find out more about each of our apprentices below.

Luke Bennett: I went to a technology school where I focused on ICT and then again in college, so I am excited to start at Unboxed Consulting as a junior tester. I definitely feel Unboxed Consulting will have a lot to teach me and I am looking forward to learning a lot about ICT. I am enjoying the self-organised work environment as well as the friendly London atmosphere. 

Abbie Ferguson: I did the MiddletonMurray pre-apprenticeship scheme and have now joined Unboxed Consulting to complete my NVQ in Business &amp; Administration. I am excited to be part of the team, especially in the marketing department.

Tillie McCarthy: I was previously working as an apprentice in a hair salon, however i didn&#39;t feel there was much opportunity for me in that career path. I then went on to doing a Pre-apprenticship Course at Middleton Murray where I was employed by Unboxed Consulting. I am very excited to be working with Unboxed Consulting and look forward to learning and progressing within the Sales Department. 

Shirin Ullah: I did the pre-apprenticeship programme with Middleton Murray where I was trained for 4 weeks, completing a BTEC in Customer Service and Work Skills and I am now an apprentice who has been given the opportunity to join Unboxed Consulting as an Office Admin. I am excited to be working with Unboxed Consulting as this is a great opportunity to expand my knowledge and experience the world of work.

Benjamin Giffin: I&#39;m a computer buff, I love using computers and always have done since a small age I look forward to working with Unboxed Consulting and learning new skills

The apprentice team will bring richness and diversity to our vibrant team. Our ongoing growth means that they will be kept busy with interesting clients and projects. They will be sharing more of their journey and insights during their year with us.

[Richard Stobart](/people/richard-stobart), our CEO said: &quot;The candidates were all of such a high quality and so enthusiastic that we wanted to take on more of them.  We believe that taking on apprentices will be beneficial to us, great for them and generally good for the country. Hopefully other companies will see the benefit we are getting and get onboard with the programme too.&quot;</summary>

    <title>Unboxed Consulting launch Public Sector White Paper</title>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Agile development experts Unboxed Consulting have launched a new White Paper on the effective use of Agile methodology in the Public Sector. The Paper demonstrates that Agile can still work beautifully under tough Public Sector circumstances, resulting in stellar efficiencies of cost and time – but that finding the right Product Owner is critical to its success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unboxed Consulting White Paper recognises both the formidable challenges to the adoption of Agile by government departments and the exceptional opportunities it offers, before exploring why the Product Owner is ultimately the key to its success. Given the right Product Owner, Agile has the potential to transform software development – even in the alien and hostile landscape of the Public Sector – dramatically slashing costs, timescales and risk.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of reasons why Agile shouldn’t work in the Public Sector, but none of these is a deal-breaker with a strong Product Owner. Better still, if managers learn how to find (or become) a great Product Owner then the development team will beg to work with them on the next project. Unboxed Consulting describe the characteristics of a star Product Owner, and the environment needed to enable them to do their job.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Two case studies – the e-petitions website for the Government Digital Service and an API for the 2011 Census data in partnership with the Office of National Statistics – show that Agile can bring remarkable benefits to the Public Sector, and explain why it’s slowly gaining ground over the predominant Waterfall methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;ldquo;Agile made e-petitions the success story it is. At 3p/signature (and reducing all the time), it’s hugely cost effective.&amp;ldquo;
Peter Herlihy, Product Owner of e-petitions, GDS

    <title>The Unboxed Way gains ISO9001 quality stamp </title>
    <summary type="html">Unboxed Consulting is only the second Agile organisation to gain the rigorous ISO 9001 status for its development methodology. The ISO 9000 family of standards is a third party review of quality management designed to ensure that organisations meet the needs of their customers and other stakeholders (as well as any statutory and regulatory requirements).

The standard awarded applies to the entirety of the Unboxed process – from onboarding new clients and projects, delivering the inception workshop, creating designs/wireframes, show and tell events and retrospectives. It even covers sales and marketing and the formalised client feedback process. 

Unboxed Consulting&amp;rsquo;s [Elizabeth Curson](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/elizabeth-curson) says &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re very pleased that our process has been granted ISO 9001 accreditation. We designed &amp;ldquo;The Unboxed Way&amp;ldquo; to be a robust and effective way to deliver an Agile project in a market where lots of companies say they &amp;rsquo;do Agile&amp;rsquo;, with little proof that their methods actually work. Now we can show the world that our Agile methodology meets international quality standards and how Agile is supposed to be done.&amp;ldquo; </summary>

    <title>Unboxed Consulting named in top 5 technical consultancies in NMA Top100 2012</title>
    <summary type="html">Unboxed Consulting has been named one of the top technical consultancies in the [2012 New Media Age Top100](http://top100.nma.co.uk/) list of the most respected and sophisticated agencies in digital media.&amp;nbsp; This annual chart is the definitive guide to the UK&amp;rsquo;s top 100 digital marketing, design &amp;amp; build and technical agencies.

As one of the few Agile and Ruby on Rails-led companies, Unboxed Consulting stands unique among a host of more traditional digital agencies.

[Richard Stobart](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/richard-stobart), CEO at Unboxed Consulting said, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve been the &amp;lsquo;Agile Grown Ups&amp;rsquo; for some time now and it&amp;rsquo;s great that the industry is recognising this. Our creative approach and robust processes mean we are trusted with some of the most advanced digital initiatives in the UK, from complex Video on Demand integration programmes at Channel 5 to government applications such as e-petitions.

One of Unboxed Consulting&amp;rsquo;s Ruby on Rails experts and organiser of LRUG (London Ruby Users Group), [Murray Steele](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/murray-steele) added, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see that we&amp;rsquo;re the only Ruby on Rails provider in the list. Ruby is fast becoming the platform of choice for large scale, innovative applications, highlighted by the fact that government is embracing the platform. So it&amp;rsquo;s exciting that we&amp;rsquo;re now counted among the big traditional Java and PHP players.&amp;rdquo;</summary>

    <title>Unboxed Consulting wins e-petitions contract through G-Cloud</title>
    <summary type="html">[e-petitions](http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/) has chosen Unboxed Consulting to support the online petition site 

The site enables members of the public to create and sign petitions online to influence government and parliament in the UK; those that receive more than 100,000 in signatures will be considered for debate in the House of Commons. 

Unboxed Consulting created e-petitions, the online public service application, in 2011 and has now won the contract to provide support to users and administrators of the site. 

e-petitions is one of several innovative online applications to be delivered by the Government Digital Service, under the stewardship of Peter Herlihy. Unboxed director and co-founder, [Richard Stobart](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/richard-stobart), says: &amp;ldquo;Having created e-petitions for the Government Digital Service, we’re delighted to be supporting it going forward and play a role in its ongoing success. The system represents a real opportunity for anyone in the UK to create change in an area they are passionate about and we’re proud to be chosen to suppor this.&amp;ldquo;

G-Cloud is a collection of companies. 

Unboxed was accepted in 2012 and is now kicking off the first project with epetitions – picked from G-Cloud

    <title>Agile masters, Unboxed Consulting, use lego and ideation to teach the agile methodology </title>
    <summary type="html">We’ve been the &amp;lsquo;Agile Grown Ups&amp;rsquo; of the development market for a while now, bringing the power of agile to serious projects and high stake applications, such as the government’s [e-petitions site](http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk).  This month we’ve being sharing the Agile approach with the big wide world… 

At the end of May, we took Agile &amp;lsquo;lego-style&amp;rsquo; to [Digital Shoreditch](http://http://digitalshoreditch.com/) – the festival celebrating the outstanding creative, technical and entrepreneurial talent of East London and Tech City. 

[Richard Stobart](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/richard-stobart) and Tom Dickinson ran a huge live workshop session in the Big Top designed using lego to simplify and explain how agile works in practice. Teams of visitors tried out Agile methodology for themselves, building towns and amenities and experiencing the full Agile cycle in a single hour. 

One visitor rated the workshop as &amp;ldquo;…the most interesting and exciting table top session I’ve seen in my career. In five minutes we had already built a town – using any other methodology, we’d still be talking about it…&amp;rdquo;

In June, we took Agile and our approach to ideation to one of the largest most creative global advertising agencies in the world.  We used The Unboxed Way to help their people solve problems more creatively. We worked through a series of left/right brain stretching and creative exercises. Step one – use the right brain extensively and freely. Step two – immediately switch to an intense left brain task. Step three – apply newly flexed brain to a real business challenge. Ideas came thick and fast. Some were pretty awesome (given that they work for one of the world’s top advertising agency, we knew they might well be).</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Contiki, the global tours operator for 18-35 year olds has once again teamed up with Unboxed Consulting to launch two new sites: a video competition site and &lt;a href=&quot;http://za.contiki.com/contikicares/&quot;&gt;Contiki Cares&lt;/a&gt;. The competition site engages travellers and encourages them to share activities though videos, photos and stories. Fellow travellers then choose and vote for the best entry. Fittingly &lt;a href=&quot;http://contiki.co.uk/contests/movember-grow-mo-or-faux-mo&quot;&gt;Movember&lt;/a&gt; is the first competition and includes both real and faux mo&amp;nbsp;entries (for the ladies)&amp;nbsp;with the closing date of 10 December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unboxed were involved in all aspects of this competition site - from&amp;nbsp;user experience,&amp;nbsp;design, development to full testing. It involved social media integration, including customising the YouTube interface with Contiki&amp;rsquo;s branding and style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This follows on from the launch of &lt;a href=&quot;http://za.contiki.com/contikicares/&quot;&gt;Contiki Cares&lt;/a&gt; which showcases Contiki&amp;#39;s socially responsible projects. It features their partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://za.contiki.com/contikicares/mar-leaders&quot;&gt;Mesoamerican Reef (MAR) Leadership Program&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which supports young, local environmentalists as well as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://za.contiki.com/contikicares/oceana&quot;&gt;Oceana&lt;/a&gt;, an organisation dedicated to protecting and restoring oceans of the world.&amp;nbsp;Unboxed Consulting created a microsite that included integration with&amp;nbsp;YouTube,&amp;nbsp;Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and other social media platforms to create a customised social media feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both solutions were created to give Contiki&amp;rsquo;s editors maximum flexibility through their content management system, providing them with the ability to fully customise blocks of HTML and CSS styled content.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unboxed launches a new website with MySchoolDirect for M&amp;S</title>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://myschooldirect.com/welcome&quot;&gt;MySchoolDirect&lt;/a&gt; specialises in partnering with vendors of children&amp;#39;s clothing to raise funds for schools in the UK. When they needed a web development agency to design and develop a bespoke school uniform website&amp;nbsp;with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marksandspencer.com/&quot;&gt;M&amp;amp;S&lt;/a&gt;, they came to Unboxed Consulting.&amp;nbsp;MySchooldirect wanted to work with Ruby on Rails web developers, and also liked Unboxed Consulting&amp;#39;s Agile way of working.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 6 weeks, the website was designed, developed and then launched to coincide with the first term of the school year. The project started with the end user in mind and included full user experience analysis, as well as user testing once functionality was delivered. &amp;nbsp;Our Agile methodology allowed Unboxed to react quickly&amp;nbsp;to changes, from updating functionality due to user feedback to last minute branding changes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Now schools are able to browse the M&amp;amp;S catalogue, sign up to promotional events and create catalogues specific to their school uniforms. In addition, an online forum was built to allow parents to engage with their schools and find out more about the scheme.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unboxed presents at the Agile Business Conference 2011</title>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The Agile Business Conference is a major European Agile conference providing a single forum to explore the effective implementation of Agile methodologies. It was held in London from 4 &amp;ndash; 6 Oct 2011 and Unboxed Consulting&amp;rsquo;s Matt Frank, a senior Agile consultant, presented on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Path to Enlightenment: &amp;lsquo;Being&amp;rsquo; Agile Is More Important Than &amp;lsquo;Doing&amp;rsquo; Agile&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme for this year&amp;rsquo;s Agile Business Conference focused on the maturity and acceptability of Agile as evidenced by recent significant successes and developments across the public and private sectors. Matt&amp;rsquo;s session&amp;nbsp;examined what &amp;#39;doing&amp;#39; Agile in an organisation means and&amp;nbsp;looked at a number of different Agile methods, technical disciplines, and behaviour patterns which result in the early and continuous delivery of working software.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big Brother’s task completed by Unboxed Consulting</title>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Unboxed Consulting has just completed a web integration project for Channel 5, which makes the new series of Celebrity Big Brother even more interactive and accessible through Channel5.com.&amp;nbsp; Completed in only seven weeks, on time and on budget, the new content integrates seamlessly with the Channel5.com homepage, provides an exclusive section for Celebrity Big Brother content, and for the first time introduces online eviction voting via Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;This project was successfully developed by Unboxed&amp;rsquo;s Cape Town team who worked with Channel 5&amp;rsquo;s designer and product owner using Agile development methodologies. The Agile approach ensured that working as a distributed team was not a hindrance by using daily stand up meetings, a regular &amp;ldquo;show &amp;amp; tell&amp;rdquo; as the software developed, and retrospective discussions.&amp;nbsp; Online planning tools meant that all members of the team, including Channel 5&amp;rsquo;s product owner, could see the status of project elements with total transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Celebrity Big Brother fans can now see more content then ever before for up-to-the-minute gossip, exclusive videos, photos and information about the housemates. They can also play the ultimate &amp;lsquo;big brother&amp;rsquo; by casting their votes for the first time using Facebook and mobile. As Big Brother says &amp;ndash; you decide! Find out more at the Celebrity Big Brother &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.channel5.com/shows/celebrity-big-brother&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Gareth Cliff app for fans - designed and developed by Unboxed</title>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gareth Cliff is a radio and TV personality in South Africa. He is a breakfast show host, an Idols judge for the South African version, and has over 500,000 fans on twitter and facebook. Unboxed was asked to create an exclusive, entertaining and unique app for Gareth&amp;rsquo;s fans and the iPhone version launched this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From initial designs, wireframes and UX, Unboxed designed and developed a visually entertaining app. Fans can now wake up to Gareth&amp;#39;s impersonations of Jacob Zuma or Prince Charles in the alarm clock feature, and see what the weather is like with graphics of Gareth in different weather conditions. The main feature is the daily videos from Gareth but the app also includes&amp;nbsp;customised twitter and facebook feeds, and viral marketing features. Unboxed developed two apps with the main app being the creative one for the fans. A second app allows Gareth to record daily videos, assign publishing dates and upload to the content management system. The app for iPad users will be available in Sept 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gareth says &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m delighted to be part of the development and launch of the Gareth Cliff app - not only to be able to offer my audience content in a new, cool way with cutting-edge technology but also to partner with cutting-edge developers. &amp;nbsp;This space is increasingly becoming a primary source for &amp;#39;connecting&amp;#39; and as a broadcaster, it&amp;#39;s great to be in the forefront. The alarm clock, video blog and general ease of use in Twitter and Facebook interactivity are smooth and effective. I&amp;#39;m extremely proud of and impressed by all aspects of the new app. It&amp;#39;s quirky, functions beautifully and has character&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>e-petitions prove popular following the UK riots</title>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The UK government recently launched the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;e-petitions website&lt;/a&gt; to give citizens a voice to petition the government online. &amp;nbsp;By coinciding with the UK riots, the site received unprecedented hits with over 8000 petitions being created in 2 weeks and over 207,000 people signing a petition that &lt;a href=&quot;http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/7337&quot;&gt;convicted rioters should lose their benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unboxed Consulting as part of the Agile Delivery Network (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agiledelivery.net/&quot;&gt;ADN&lt;/a&gt;) built the new website in 5 weeks and provided the majority of the development resource. The site launched on 28 July with the functionality to create e-petitions and went fully live on 5 August once data had been published. With great interest in e-petitions, peak demand was over 5,000 users per minute and&amp;nbsp;the team had to work with the hosting providers to resolve a few issues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e-petitions is a hot topic and received wide media coverage at the launch with the BBC Breakfast News mentioning it every 30 minutes. &amp;nbsp;It gives UK citizens a voice and makes government more accessible. &amp;nbsp;Commons Leader Sir George Young said it was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8669763/Popular-e-petitions-will-now-be-debated-in-Parliament.html&quot;&gt;&amp;lsquo;step towards a more accessible and transparent&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; Parliament and campaigns backed by 100,000 signatures would trigger consideration for debate in Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unboxed raises awareness of SME Agile experience with UK government</title>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Cabinet Office recently had discussions with Unboxed Consulting as part of the Agile Delivery Network to use Agile development processes to transform Whitehall IT. This follows on from the report &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/23/system-error&quot;&gt;System Error: Fixing the flaws in government IT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/23/system-error&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;released earlier this year which highlighted that government IT is fundamentally flawed despite spending &amp;pound;16bn annually. The report recommends&amp;nbsp;tackling two important aspects simultaneously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agile - a development strategy that emphasises flexibility, responsiveness to change and innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platform - this refers to a system-wide approach to standardising and simplifying shared elements of government IT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report conceded that an Agile strategy may be initially&amp;nbsp;difficult due to a lack of skilled practitioners but as experienced Agile developers, Unboxed Consulting knows that there is a wealth of knowledge in the SME community. The challenge is rather how to get SMEs considered for new projects and how to team up with incumbent systems integrators who lack Agile experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unboxed Consulting CEO Richard Stobart, together with Andy de Vale co-founded the Agile Delivery Network which is a group representing SMEs both developing in and consulting on Agile techniques. At the meeting with the Cabinet Office, they raised the issue of whether suppliers are being selected for their Agile credentials such as Accenture and HP, lead developers on the &amp;pound;2bn Universal Credit System. Another concern is that some &amp;lsquo;Agile&amp;rsquo; projects, such as a large HMRC (Revenue &amp;amp; Customs) project, are being run by inexperienced Agile practitioners which could lead to ineffective Agile implementation and a potential misunderstanding of the value of Agile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately Malcolm Whitehouse, the new DWP (Dept. for Work &amp;amp; Pensions) deputy CIO, is keen for SMEs to get involved in government IT as the move to Agile is unlikely to come from the large system integrators. &amp;nbsp;He is planning on working with the Agile Delivery Network to move some of this activity forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2011/06/20/247006/Cabinet-Office-turns-to-agile-SMEs-to-reform-Whitehall-IT.htm&quot;&gt;Cabinet Office turns to agile SMEs to reform Whitehall IT development, 16 June 2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
