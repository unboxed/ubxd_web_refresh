  title: "Upgrading the platform to use latest core technologies"
  content: "Core technologies were dated, with versions of software language and frameworks reaching end of life. This severely limited Naturejobs’ opportunity to utilise the latest framework innovations and increased security risk. We successfully planned and delivered upgrades of Ruby software, Rails framework and further business features."

  title: "UX enhanced to benefit user journey"
  content: "With feedback of long and complicated user journeys on the current website, along with a high drop off rate, the user experience from start to finish was investigated and refined. Unnecessary stages in the user journey were removed, greatly reducing the drop-off rate. Every iteration was tested and assessed against real user data, resulting in a smoother and more concise journey."

  title: "Establishing valuable metrics for success"
  content: "To gauge the site’s success, Naturejobs had previously been measuring page views and similar metrics. Customer feedback and studied site Analytics were reviewed to learn what users wanted and valued. Relevant metrics were then established, such as the number of CV uploads achieved and job searches conducted. From this, Naturejobs were able to remove many redundant and unused features, resulting in a reduction of their maintenance overheads."
