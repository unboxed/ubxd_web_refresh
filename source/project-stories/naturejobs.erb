  introduction: "Recruitment site revitalisation for major scientific publishing group"

collaboration:
  title: "Close, early engagement with stakeholders and development team fosters confidence and aligns interests"
  results:
    - "Streamlined website development by gaining stakeholder buy-in"
    - "Constant engagement between Unboxed and Naturejobs throughout process"
    - "Reduced overheads by removing unused legacy features from large website"

technology:
  title: "Upgrading the platform to use latest core technologies"
  content: "Core technologies on the site were dated, with versions of software language and frameworks reaching end of life. This severely limited Naturejobs’ opportunity to utilise the latest framework innovations and increased security risk. We successfully planned and delivered upgrades of both Ruby software and Rails framework for the site to use the latest versions, alongside the delivery of further business features."

collaboration_quote:
  quote: "Unboxed Consulting were part of the team we were used to working with, I didn’t feel like we were customers."

user_journey:
  title: "UX enhanced to benefit user journey"
  content: "With feedback of long and complicated user journeys on the current website, along with a high drop off rate, the user experience from start to finish was investigated and refined. Unnecessary stages in the user journey were removed, greatly reducing the drop-off rate. Every iteration was tested and assessed against real user data, resulting in a smoother and more concise journey."

metrics:
  title: "Establishing valuable metrics for success"
  content: "To gauge the site’s success, the Naturejobs developers had previously been measuring page views and similar metrics. We reviewed customer feedback and studied site Analytics to learn what users really wanted and valued. Relevant metrics were then established, such as the number of CV uploads achieved and job searches conducted. From this, Naturejobs were able to remove many redundant and unused features, resulting in a reduction of their maintenance overheads."
