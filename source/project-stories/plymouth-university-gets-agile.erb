  image_description: "Sprint retrospective"

introduction:
  title: "Software development and IT services revolutionised through increased productivity, transparency and confidence"
  content:
    - "Ad hoc and unsatisfactory software development overhauled"
    - "University engaged by improved transparency"
    - "Results prompted other departments to become more Agile"

  image_description: "Sprint mood board"

working_closely_highlight: "The Unboxed team worked closely with Plymouth University to bring the theory of Agile to reality."

process_structure:
  title: "Bringing structure to the software production process"
  content: "The university's software services worked on an ad hoc basis, with little oversight or integration with other departments. We were enlisted to create a robust but flexible development process, building a structure for development where there had been none."

agile_quote:
  quote: "A lot of organisations claim to be Agile, but they just cherry pick techniques. Unboxed have a complete vision for delivering Agile."
  source: "Paul Westmore, Interim CIO, Plymouth University"

transparency:
  title: "Inspiring confidence through transparency"
  content: "Whereas the development service was previously left at arm's length by the university, instilling Agile processes better integrated it with other stakeholders. Regular show-and-tells allowed ongoing feedback, hugely improving the quality of software and reputation. As a direct result, other departments requested Agile training from Unboxed, immediately seeing the advantages in terms of efficiency and productivity."

pride:
  title: "Creating pride in the development service"
  content: "A further benefit was that the clear structure gave control back to the development team and allowed them to participate in a process that the university bought into fully. We continue to work with Plymouth University to embed Agile processes throughout their IT services â€“ work that the teams have described as engaging and fun as well as extremely valuable."
