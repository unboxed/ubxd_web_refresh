introduction:
  title: "New website led by Unboxed"
  content: "With the arrival of expensive tuition fees, universities have had to become more commercially oriented. Plymouth University realised that prospective students learn about them primarily through their website, and that the current site did not reflect their quality. A team from Unboxed worked alongside developers from the University to rapidly overhaul the website, adding functionality in two-week sprints."

design_testing:
  title: "​​Every design fully tested with students before build"
  content: "Since the University and students had different ideas about what was required, the team ran sessions with all stakeholders but with particular emphasis on the main users (students). They then worked to deliver the most important features first, iterating to add further functionality on the basis of the evidence gathered for what would be most effective."

New functionality was being released early and often, directly in line with user feedback. Our team co-located with Plymouth University, living in a specially rented flat in Plymouth."
