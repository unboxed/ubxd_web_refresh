agile_pioneers:
  title: "Creating a team of agile pioneers"
  content: "Embedding our team into the Reed Learning team allowed us to introduce agile and lean ways of working in an organisation that hadn't used these before.

With ceremonies, systems and our working space all set up, in place and ticked off our checklist, the newly formed Reed Learning / Unboxed team was in a strong position to begin delivering results."

piloting:
  title: "Piloting the team’s first agile project"

Fortnightly Show & Tells were scheduled to involve stakeholders in this new way of working and used to provide updates on the most important delivered work and priorities, building up trust."

quote_3:
  quote: "This pilot project was the perfect way to start small in moving towards a more agile way of working.

key_features:
  title: "Key features validated through customer engagement"
  content: "To understand the features customers would immediately start using, the team took a lean approach, talking directly to real customers. Working side-by-side with these customers, the team developed, tested and iterated prototypes. Early on, they began to understand exactly which specific features customers would immediately pay for and use."

Sharing this result with stakeholders increased confidence that this transformation had already begun to show results, which were not only benefitting the internal team, but also the customer."
