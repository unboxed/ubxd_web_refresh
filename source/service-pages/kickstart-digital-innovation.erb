introduction:
  content:
  - "This is where we kickstart your journey to digital innovation. This journey often begins with an idea for a new digital product or service, a problem youâ€™re facing or how you might improve an existing solution."
  - "We begin by talking to your customers, as well as internal stakeholders, to listen to their pain points and understand their desired outcomes. Through these interactions, we form personas and user journeys to take forward. Following this, we explore different ideas through simple prototyping, testing these with customers, then summarising our insights in a portfolio of valuable innovative opportunities for your organisation."
