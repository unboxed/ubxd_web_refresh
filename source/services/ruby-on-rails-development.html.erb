        Why Ruby on Rails?
      </h2>

      <p class="text-tile__paragraph">
        Ruby on Rails is directly at the heart of some of the most successful digital products and services, providing a responsive framework to deliver robust and dynamic applications.
      </p>

      <ul class="text-tile__list">
        <li class="text-tile__list-item">
          Ruby on Rails enables rapid application development to deliver more features in less time, allowing you to speedily release a minimum viable product (MVP) and reach the market place.
        </li>
        <li class="text-tile__list-item">
          The framework is secure by default, allowing you to concentrate on what matters the most to your business.
        </li>
        <li class="text-tile__list-item">
          As open source software, Ruby on Rails is supported by a large community (including our CTO and Rails Core Member, <a href="/people/#andrew-white)">Andrew White</a>). The community produces and shares reusable components (called Gems), and contributes back to open source.
        </li>
        <li class="text-tile__list-item">
          Common structure and coding practices produce high quality and easy-to-maintain web applications.
        </li>
        <li class="text-tile__list-item">
          Ruby on Rails' emphasis on RESTful application design makes them seamless to integrate with other software and applications via APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
        </li>
        <li class="text-tile__list-item">
          Ruby on Rails is a scalable framework, accommodating for <a href="http://unboxed.co/blog/scaling-rails-through-650-million-requests-in-5-days-the-donald-trump-state-visit-petition/">increasing numbers of users</a> as your audiences grows.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-tile__paragraph">
        Ruby on Rails is the language and framework of choice for a number of organisations, including Government Digital Service, AirBnB, Groupon, Shopify, Carwow, Trainline and many more.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-tile__subtitle">
        Our approach
      </h3>

      <p class="text-tile__paragraph">
        We deliver digital products and services through a combination of Agile, Lean Startup and Design Thinking approaches. Continuous learning and adapting to change is central to all of these approaches and plays a key role in guiding our self-organising teams. We work in short improvement cycles, continuously making, testing, and learning in order to respond to customer and business needs.

      <h3 class="text-tile__subtitle">
        Our development approach
      </h3>

      <p class="text-tile__paragraph">
        Our rigorous, agile and iterative approach to software development includes continuous integration (e.g. Travis), version control (e.g. git, GitHub), test driven development (e.g. RSpec, Capybara), code reviewing (e.g. through leveraging the features of GitHub pull requests) and pair programming. Our wider technology stack includes HTML, CSS (Sass), JavaScript, JQuery, PostgreSQL, MySQL, AWS, Heroku, RSpec, Cucumber, JSON and many others.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-tile__subtitle">
        Cultural fit
      </h3>

      <p class="text-tile__paragraph">
        From day one, we blend the lines between being an external Unboxed team and an internal customer team to form one single embedded team:

      <ul class="text-tile__list">
        <li class="text-tile__list-item">

        <li class="text-tile__list-item">
          Agile ways of working â€” daily standup, regular planning and retrospectives, show and tell sessions with the core and wider team
