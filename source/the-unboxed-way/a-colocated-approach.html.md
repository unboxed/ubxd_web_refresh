# A co-located approach

From day one, we blend the lines between being an external Unboxed team and an internal customer team to form one single embedded team — our project team.


## Embedding with teams

A core part of our working way is embedding onsite with a customer team for the duration of a project. Through this way of working, we are able to engage closely with individuals and the wider team through face-to-face communication.

## Transferring and sharing knowledge

We work closely with our customers to embed the core skills of delivering an agile project, whilst “on the job”. Through close working, coaching, practical workshops and pairing sessions, we are able to transfer the skills and principles behind user-centred design to our customers, while delivering progress and results. We share and teach through ‘doing’.

## A ‘no-blame’ culture

Our teams take accountability, as a whole team, for the success of a project. Through daily standup, each individual team member is held accountable for the task they’re working on, receiving support from the Scrum Master to remove any blockers to the success of this. Our teams also perform retrospectives as a core part of each sprint to reflect on the previous sprint and address how the team (as a whole) can learn in going forward.

## Open, transparent decision-making

Through scheduling regular Show & Tell sessions during each sprint, we are able provide a platform to key project stakeholders (those who may not be involved in the day-to-day operations of a project) to share updates, progress and provide a platform for feedback and to discuss upcoming decisions.
