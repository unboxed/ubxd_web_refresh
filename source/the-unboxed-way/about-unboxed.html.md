# About Unboxed

## 12+ years of delivering end-to-end digital products and services

Unboxed was founded in our CEO’s attic in 2005, as a better way to deliver software through an agile approach. Since then, we have widened our expertise to cover the full end-to-end design and development process, going from exploration and validation of an early problem or idea through to the delivery of fully scalable and supported digital products.

## A vibrant London-based team

Our London office consists of 30 team members; a blend of designers, developers, Scrum Masters, digital strategists and more. Due to the nature of our projects, members of the team can be working from a variety of locations, including the Unboxed office, a customer’s office, out in the field or beyond.
