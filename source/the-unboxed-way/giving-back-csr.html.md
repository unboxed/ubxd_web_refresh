# Giving back (Corporate social responsbility)

We always try to give back and get involved in initiatives, wherever we can. These are just some of the initiatives that we're currently involved with.

## Lambeth Portuguese Community Wellbeing Partnership

The Lambeth Portuguese Community Wellbeing Partnership (LPCWP) is a community initiative to support and improve the health and wellbeing of the Portuguese-speaking residents across the London Borough of Lambeth. With 1-in-6 residents estimated to be native Portuguese speakers, health data indicates that many of these residents are experiencing disjointed care, highlighting healthcare inequalities across these residents.

[Leon](https://unboxed.co/people/#leon-odey-knight) has been involved in providing time and resource (through Innovation Days) to help support and drive this initiative in moving forward, with support from across the whole partnership.
