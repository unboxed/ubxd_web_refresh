# Growing our people

We hire only the best developers and designers – being best both in their minds and in their hearts. And we want them to get even better. To do this, we widely recognise that providing opportunities for our team to grow is important, so this plays a key part in our culture.


## Coaching and mentoring

Our mentoring programme has become a foundation of our culture, helping team members grow and flourish in their areas of interest. People are paired in long-term mentoring relationships - one taking the role of the mentor, and other the role of the mentee. Junior mentees are paired with a mid-level mentor and mid-level mentees are paired with a senior level mentor.

Regular scheduled mentoring sessions are encouraged to set goals, raise any blockers and retrospect
on progress, as well as just to have a catchup about how things are going.

Each member of the team also has a ‘Growing [Employee_Name]’ Trello board to keep track of their progress.

## Innovation Days

We actively encourage innovation across Unboxed by offering each team member 10 days each year to spend innovating — these are our Innovation Days.

Innovation Days allow people to take time off customer projects to explore and work on any ideas they find interesting and would like to know more about. These can be based on personal development, software development, process improvement or further — it’s an open topic. Innovation Days can either be taken as single days, used to pair with someone else or taken as a group (group Innovation Days can sometimes result in an off-site [Hackathon day](https://unboxed.co/blog/unboxed-hackathon-what-a-difference-a-day-makes/) for the whole team).

Each person is encouraged (but not required) to share what they have learned on their Innovation Days with the wider team, by either writing a blog post or sharing their story at our monthly company meeting. This isn’t mandatory though — it’s all in the spirit of openness and sharing.


## Conferences and training

Learning from others is a key part of growing our people, so each team member has an annual conference
budget of £1,000 to attend any conferences of their choice. This can either be in the UK
or further afield.

This conference budget can either go towards a number of smaller conferences throughout the year
or used for one larger conference - all depending on the individual.

*Brighton Ruby 2017 conference*

Just like Innovation Days, sharing some of the takeaways from a conference is encouraged,
sometimes in the form of a blog post:

* [RubyConf Portugal 2016](https://unboxed.co/blog/rubyconf-portugal-2016/)
* [NEXT London 2016](https://unboxed.co/blog/next-london-2016-google-cloud-platform-s-user-conference/)
* [Brighton Ruby 2017](https://unboxed.co/blog/unboxed-goes-to-brighton-ruby-2017/)


## Whines & Cheers
Whines & Cheers is our office-wide retrospective that takes place every Friday afternoon at 5pm — on the dot. We all get together in the kitchen area (with wine, beers, cheese and snacks) to retrospect on the week. Beginning with what didn’t go so well (the ‘Whines’), we then move onto what went well that week (the ‘Cheers’).

*Whines & Cheers in action*

Relevant actions are taken from the Whines side of the board and assigned to a person, aiming to solve any
Whines by the following Friday (so it doesn’t make another appearance).

We also use Whines & Cheers as a place to meet the newest joiners of our team. Instead of waiting
until the Monday morning that they “officially” join, we invite them along on the Friday beforehand
to meet the rest of the team.


## Linkers & Thinkers

Born out of our passion for idea sharing, Linkers & Thinkers is a monthly our “thinking lunch” schedule,
used to share an idea with another member of the team.

## Team lunches

On the second Friday of each month, our whole team gets together (including those working off-site
on projects) for a regular team lunch. Chosen by a different person each time, it’s a great chance
to sit down, eat together and have a catch up.


## Away days

Once a year, we schedule a day or afternoon off to have an Away Day. We invite our alumni to join us too.
Previous Away Days have included Go Ape, [You Can Bike Too](http://www.youcanbiketoo.org/) and a sports day in London Fields.
