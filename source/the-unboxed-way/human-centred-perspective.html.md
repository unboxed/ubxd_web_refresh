# A human-centred perspective

People are at the centre of everything we do. The products and services we work on are used by people,
managed by people, and delivered by people. They are only useful if they serve the needs of end users
and make life easier for our clients’ employees. In order to deliver a successful product, we need
to understand the people that are going to interact with it from day to day.

We employ ethnographic research methods to uncover user needs and pain points. We conduct _interviews_,
_user testing sessions_, and _co-design workshops_ to understand them better and steer our ideas in the
right direction. We value the validation provided by quantitative metrics, but always combine them
with qualitative insights that provide us with a much deeper understanding of the people we work with.
This allows us to learn more about potential risks and assumptions we’re making about our product.

We believe that observing users while they use our products is more valuable than just asking them
to talk about it. That’s why we continuously make prototypes and test them with users. We prefer
testing with fewer people and more often as this works well with our continuous learning and
delivery cycles. We encourage all team members, as well as our clients, to participate in these
sessions. This creates a shared understanding of user needs and greatly enhances discussions about
how to build the product. It also reminds everyone on the team that what they’re developing is
ultimately going to be judged by the users.
