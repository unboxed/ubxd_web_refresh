# Welcome to The Unboxed Way

The Unboxed Way is a guide to the way in which we do things at Unboxed. As our general set of principles, ways of working, cultural fit (and more), this guide has been grown and developed by our team through discussions and workshops to begin sharing more about how Unboxed works as a team and an organisation.

This guide isn’t set in stone, changing over time as we iterate and evolve as a team, continuing to grow as an organisation. It will grow as we learn new things, based on our own experiences and through learning from the experiences of others. Every member of the team has access to contribute to the ongoing growth, contributing individual and team experiences.

So sit back, relax and enjoy exploring our way of thinking. This is a look into how we create successful digital products and work as an organisation.
