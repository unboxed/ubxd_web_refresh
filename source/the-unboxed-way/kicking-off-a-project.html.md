# Kicking off a project

Not all projects kick off in the same way, but this is just one example of the process that we might go through:

## Step one: an opportunity arises

Someone reaches out to discuss a new product or project idea with us. This can be via email (to hello@unboxed.co), our homepage contact form, [Calendly](https://calendly.com/unboxed) or a call to the office.


## Step two: a call or meeting

A meeting or call is arranged to discuss the idea or project in further detail. We prefer a meeting over a phone call as it’s always great to meet people face-to-face. Through this, we aim to highlight all major areas including any existing teams, scope, budget, potential timescales and more.


## Step three: team discussion and proposal

Members of the team get together to share and discuss the project scope and answer any questions. Based on the scope, a proposal is put together which includes a delivery team, timescales, rates and other relevant experiences. This is sent across to the contact, with an open invitation for a follow-up call to talk through the proposal and answer any questions.


## Step four: alignment workshop

We arrange a time and day to meet the contact’s team and internal stakeholders, who we’ll be working alongside. This is a two-day alignment workshop is where the project vision is shared, expectations are aligned, roles and responsibilities are decided and the product backlog begins to form.

## Step five: sprint one begins

When we’re all agreed, as a single team, the first [sprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Code_sprints) begins.
