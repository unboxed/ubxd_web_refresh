# Our agile approach

The fast pace of technological changes and an increasing complexity of interactions with customers,
in a digital context, demand a new approach to developing products and services. In an environment
of uncertainty, companies need to be agile, continuously innovating and learning about how
to best shape their solutions.

We deliver digital products using a combination of elements from _Scrum_,
_Lean Startup_ and _Design Thinking_ methodologies. Continuous learning and adapting to change
is central to all of these approaches and plays a key role in responding to uncertainty.

This forms the basis of our agile approach and its main ingredients:

* [Teamwork and collaboration](/the-unboxed-way/teamwork-and-collaboration);
* [Short learning cycles (or sprints)](/the-unboxed-way/short-learning-cycles); and
* [A human-centred perspective](/the-unboxed-way/human-centred-perspective)
