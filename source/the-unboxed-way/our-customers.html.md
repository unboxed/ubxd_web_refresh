# Our customers and us

We like to work with a wide range of customers and organisations, all working to solve different, exciting and interesting problems.


## Who we work with

From small funded startups and corporates, to the NHS and private healthcare, through to local councils and central government, we work with a diverse range of organisations and teams.

Some of these organisations include:

Although we’re not sector-specific in the work we do, our recent projects and experiences with healthcare organisations, such as [SH:24](https://unboxed.co/product-stories/sh24/), [Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust](https://unboxed.co/product-stories/guys-and-st-thomas/), [Public Health England](https://unboxed.co/news/unboxed-awarded-two-public-health-england-contracts/) and Southwark CCG, have opened up a focus on other projects within healthcare.


## Who we don’t work with

We like to work with teams and organisations who are trying to do some good and improve the
lives of their users. We also take an ethical approach when considering who we work with.
For these reasons, we choose not to work within industries such as gambling, tobacco,
payday loans or similar.


## How we meet our customers

We meet our customers through a wide range of different ways. Most of our projects arrive through:

- Referrals and recommendations
- Connections and word of mouth
- Opportunities published through the [Digital Marketplace](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/)
- Google searches (SEO/PPC)


## Our relationship with our customers

Our customers are very important to us. Without them, we wouldn’t be able to work on the exciting products or experience the amazing projects that we do.

We aim to build good relationships with our customers, from our very first point of contact, by treating them as part of the Unboxed team. Aligned with our embedded team approach — our door is always open, there’s always a seat available in the office (and a coffee in the machine) and each customer becomes an honorary member of our (very purple) caricature wall of fame.

We openly encourage sharing and learning between our customers and our wider network by regularly inviting our customers to speak at our events to share their stories, their challenges and successes and their experiences. As we continually expand our community of customers, friends and partners, we are able to open up further conversations with other teams and organisations facing similar challenges.
