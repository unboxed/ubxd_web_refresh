# Our events

## Andrew White’s Technical Breakfast Club
Andrew White’s Technical Breakfast Club is our technical meetup. As a [Rails Core Member](http://rubyonrails.org/community) (and our CTO), [Andrew](https://unboxed.co/people/#andrew-white) presents topics based on the latest developments and experiences across the Rails framework.

Previous topics have included:

* What’s coming in the latest Rails release
* [Scaling up Rails in a national referendum](https://unboxed.co/blog/andrew-white-s-technical-breakfast-club-scaling-up-rails-in-a-national-referendum/)

## Design Club

This is our internal design meetup, held once a month for those interested in discussing and exploring different areas of design. For each Design Club session, a member of the team is selected to present a topic to the wider group, then heading into a broader discussion. This can be anything from an article or book that may be of interest, to project experience or a new area of interest.

## Faster than Lightning

Faster than Lightning is our informal meetup (organised and ran by [Neil](https://unboxed.co/people/#neil-van-beinum)) where developers present and share snippets of code for discussion. Previously ran as a monthly internal event, we decided to throw our doors open to invite our wider network, with the aim of sharing knowledge and ideas across the wider developer community.

## Product Innovation

Product Innovation is our series of product-based events for our customers, wider network and those who we’d like to get to know. Usually hosted around three times a year, we invite a range of speakers (including members of our team) to present innovative stories and experiences, with an aim of inspiring attendees. Also including practical workshop elements throughout, the aim is for attendees to learn methods to be able to take away and implement within their own teams and organisation.
