# Our recruitment process

Applying for a new role is a big decision, so we aim to give as much support and access to the Unboxed team as possible throughout our recruitment process. 

## Step one: Submitting a CV
A CV is submitted to [Steve](https://unboxed.co/people/#steve-lennon) (our Delivery Director) via iwantajob@unboxed.co, along with a bit about the candidate.

## Step two: Internal discussion
Each CV is added to our recruitment Pivotal Tracker project board. Following an internal discussion, the team evaluates the candidateâ€™s skills, experience and availability against the role.

## Step three: Setting a practical task
If the candidate seems a good fit for the role, we send them a practical task (a coded technical test for developer roles and a design task for designer roles). We ask that this is submitted within one week, ensuring enough notice. We aim to provide feedback on a solution within the next week, even if we decide not to progress with the application. 

## Step four: Interviewing and a pairing session
Following the test/task submission, a candidate is invited into the Unboxed office for an interview and technical pairing session/whiteboard challenge. During a pairing session, the candidate takes a member of the team through their solution, exploring and highlighting the approach taken. For design roles, we set a pairing whiteboard design challenge.

## Step five: Meeting a director
As the final application step, a candidate meets on our of Directors for a conversation.

## Step six: Making an offer
If the relationship seems to fit, we make an offer with an initial start date. Once their employment contract is signed, a new employee gains access to all relevant Unboxed systems and is invited along to the next Whines & Cheers session (our Friday afternoon company-wide retrospective) to meet the team.

From start to finish, our recruitment process usually takes around three weeks.
