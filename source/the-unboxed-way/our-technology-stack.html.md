## Why Ruby on Rails?
Ruby on Rails is directly at the heart of some of the most successful digital products and services, providing a responsive framework to deliver robust and dynamic applications.

* Ruby on Rails enables rapid application development to deliver more features in less time, allowing you to speedily reach a minimum viable product and the market
* The framework is secure by default, allowing you to concentrate on what matters the most to your business
* As open source software, Ruby on Rails is supported by a large community (including our CTO and Rails Core Member, [Andrew White](https://unboxed.co/people/#andrew-white)) — the community produces and shares reusable components (called Gems), and contributes back to open source
* Common structure and coding practices produce high quality and easy-to-maintain web applications
* Ruby on Rails’ emphasis on RESTful application design makes them seamless to integrate with other software and applications via APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
* Ruby on Rails is a scalable framework, accommodating for [increasing numbers of users](http://unboxed.co/blog/scaling-rails-through-650-million-requests-in-5-days-the-donald-trump-state-visit-petition/) as your audiences grow

Ruby on Rails is the language and framework of choice for a number of organisations, including [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/), [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/), [Groupon](https://www.groupon.co.uk/), [Shopify](https://www.shopify.co.uk/), [Carwow](https://www.carwow.co.uk/), [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/) and many more.

## Our development approach
Our rigorous, agile and iterative approach to software development includes continuous integration (e.g. Travis), version control (e.g. git, GitHub), test driven development (e.g. RSpec, Capybara), code reviewing (through leveraging the features of GitHub pull requests) and pair programming. Our wider technology stack includes HTML, CSS (Sass), JavaScript, JQuery, PostgreSQL, MySQL, AWS, Heroku, RSpec, Cucumber, JSON and many others.
