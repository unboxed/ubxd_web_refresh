# The Unboxed principles

To help guide us on our way, we’ve devised a set of principles that will guide us.
These are essential to who we are and help us to shape everything we do together.
We develop digital products. not only because we do it well and are passionate about it,
but also because it allows us to live by our principles:

## 1. Openness and transparency

We love to live in a world that is open and transparent, and information is shared freely.
In order to live up to this, as a company, we ensure we’re honest and don’t exaggerate or deceive.
We share as much as we can about what we’re doing.

## 2. Learning by doing

Progress is achieved through experimentation, so we actively encourage people to go out and try
new things, rather than just talk about them. From coding through to processes, feedback loops
are built into everything we do, allowing us to consistently learn from what we’re doing and improve.

## 3. Making sense of complexity

Complex problems are untangled by understanding the bigger picture. We challenge these
difficult-to-understand situations by starting off small and keeping everything simple. Even when it isn’t.

## 4. Healthier relationships

We like people. Working closely with our customers, and including them as part of our project teams,
encourages key collaboration and allows us to learn from each other. We acknowledge the achievements
of others, as well as our own, to help us grow.

## 5. Questioning the status quo

We know that today’s best solution could change by tomorrow, so we’re always challenging the status quo.
We are constantly striving to do thing in better and different ways. Continuous innovation enables
us to explore new technologies, create new opportunities and routinely seek new and better ways of doing things.
