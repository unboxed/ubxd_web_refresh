# Product development lifecycle

![Product development lifecycle](/the-unboxed-way/images/product-dev-lifecycle.jpg)

*Product development lifecycle*

All of our work is conducted in short learning cycles. Activities and focus of these cycles, however, change depending on the maturity of the product or service that we’re currently working on. Our product development lifecycle framework describes the journey from an initial idea or problem that provided a spark, through to a live working, end-to-end product or service. Our approach is aligned with the Government Digital Service (GDS) [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual).

Throughout this journey, we work closely with our customers to teach and embed new skills and transform the way they work. We encourage them to become a true learning organisation, continuously make improvements and respond to their users’ feedback.

## Discover and validate

The journey towards a new product often starts with a problem or with an idea around how to improve an existing solution. In both cases, our approach is to:

* Begin by understanding the environment that this product will exist in
* Engage with users, as well as key internal stakeholders, to understand their pain points and desired outcomes
* Describe and form typical users and their needs through personas and user journeys
* Analyse existing research and previous attempts to tackle this problem
* Explore different ideas and opportunities by building simple prototypes and testing them with users for feedback

The main focus of this stage is learning. A number of ideas and generated, trying to understanding they’re desirable to potential users, technologically feasible, and financially viable for the organisation. We use these criteria to prioritise them and build a portfolio of valuable innovation opportunities to take forward.

## Build and launch

When an idea for a product is sufficiently validated and associated risks are well understood, it’s time to turn it into a market-ready digital solution. The vision of the product is explored by writing user stories — short statements to describe a requirement through a desired outcome for the user. Designers and developers work together to develop those stories into a working product. These user stories are constantly refined based on feedback, interviews, A/B testing and other methods. We work to deploy an improved version of the product with each sprint, ensuring that it consistently passes our automated testing and other quality assurance processes.

Our aim is to develop a [minimum viable product (MVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) as soon as possible and share it with its first real users. This means that the product, as well as all the supporting operational processes, need to be ready to successfully perform in market. This includes setting up customer support, CRM, analytics and other internal processes. We start measuring and analysing the key performance metrics as these will guide the path for future improvements as well as provide a solid, quantitative validation of the overall business model.

## Grow and improve

Launching a digital product to become a live service is only the beginning of its journey. As technology and customer expectations will evolve, our customers need to be ready to respond to these changes through a process of continuous improvement. Traditional management practices, however, are too slow and don’t work well in this context. We work with our customers to transform the way they work, establishing this culture of continuous learning and cross-silo collaboration. We teach them to embrace continuous change and adopt a habit of iteratively building, measuring and learning to keep improving their product.

During this stage, the product becomes more refined and acquires an increased number of users. We support the development of the product to ensure it can scale, as necessary. We continuously innovate to stay ahead of the competition and deliver the best possible experience to customers.
