# Growing our own products
As a product development company, product incubation is an essential part of what we do. We don’t only work on products for our customers though, we work on our own too. We have created an environment where idea for new products can form and flourish.

We encourage any member of our team with an idea to explore and develop this further, in the
early stages, through their Innovation Days. Because we have so many ideas floating around,
we limit the number of our own products that we work on at any one time to three.
This gives enough time, focus and resource to give each product a good chance
of succeeding (or failing).

As each product gains traction, the team working on it is scaled up and we find more
partners to provide their expertise and investment in going forward.

Three of our current products in development include:

* [char.gy](http://char.gy/) — an electric vehicle charging solution for drivers with no access to off-street parking
* [LoGov Platform](http://logovplatform.co.uk/) — a Community Interest Company for enabling public sector collaboration
* [LIFT](http://lift.money/) — an invoice financing platform

We have also invested in [50th Generation](https://www.50thgeneration.org/) — a purpose-led accelerator for businesses on a mission to make meaning and money.
