# Sharing what we do

We like to be open and transparent in sharing everything that we do. We do this by:

## Creating product stories

For each project we work on, a product story is created (our version of a case study). We use these to share the results and impact of a project, as well as an overview of our approach, sharing insights and learnings. Each product story is published on [Unboxed Web](https://unboxed.co/) and a one-page version is created to include in our proposals.

Our product stories can be found [here](https://unboxed.co/product-stories).


## Publishing blog posts

As part of our culture of open sharing and learning, every member of the team is encouraged to write and publish blog posts. These can either be solo or paired posts with someone else. The choice of topic is open to the author, but some usual topics include anything from project experiences to technical ‚Äúhow to‚Äù guides to conference overviews, and beyond.

Our blog can be found [here](https://unboxed.co/blog).

## Organising events

We run a number of events for a wide range of audiences, from developers to Heads of Digital, Innovation Managers to designers and many more. We run our events to engage with our network, share stories, hear from others, share learnings and open up conversations with new people. Some of our events include Faster than Lightning code talks, Product Innovation workshops and Andrew White‚Äôs Technical Breakfast Club.

## Speaking at conferences and meetups

Presenting at conferences and meetups allows us to share our stories and experiences with those who may be facing similar challenges within their organisation. We share real accounts of our projects, not only highlighting our successes but also the challenges and barriers we‚Äôve faced along the way.

## Sharing on social media

Sharing some of our latest happenings via our social media channels helps us to keep in touch with our network and highlight some of the interesting things that we‚Äôre up to, as well engage with others.

Our social media channels of choice are [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ubxd) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/unboxed-consulting/).


## Contributing to open source projects

We give everyone the time and space to contribute to open source projects, giving back to the community.
At the same time, we have made some of our own projects open source, and encourage other external
people to contribute to them too.
