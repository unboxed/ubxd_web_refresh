# Short learning cycles (or sprints)

![Short learning cycles](/the-unboxed-way/images/learning-cycle.jpg)

*Short learning cycles*

We work in one-week or two-week learning and delivery cycles that we call _sprints_.
This structure enables us to reliably deliver valuable outputs to our customers.
Emphasis on continuous making and learning helps us identify potential gaps in our plan and respond
to them accordingly. We don’t focus our delivery on features or requirements, as these might change.
Instead, we make sure that each sprint brings us closer to the desired outcomes for our
customers and their end users. In each sprint we:
* _Build_ a prototype or part of the product;
* _Measure_ the response from end-users; and
* _Learn_ from it to refine future product plans

We want our customers to deliver value to their users as soon as possible. We aim to build a working
end-to-end product in its simplest form, ensuring that it delivers tangible value to end users.
We call this the [minimum viable product (MVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product). While the MVP may not have all the features of
a mature product, it enables our customers to put their solution on the market early. It allows them
to start earning revenue, validate their concept and get valuable feedback from real users
to improve the product and stay ahead of the competition. With each sprint the MVP gets more
and more refined, providing an improved experience and better value to customers.

Sprints include a number of meetings (often referred to as “ceremonies”) designed for the team to share their learnings and adjust plans on a regular basis. These meetings include:

## Sprint planning

The core team meet to plan the workload that they estimate can be achieved across the sprint (either one or two weeks). Any undefined user stories are discussed across the team, the scope is agreed and the [effort is estimated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker).

## Daily standup

A short meeting, normally at the beginning of the working day, usually taking 10-15 minutes. Members across the core team share progress updates — what they achieved the day before, what they plan on doing this day and any blockers they may be experiencing. Any tasks to be considered “blocked” (it can’t be worked on due to an external factor) are picked up by the Scrum Master to remove these dependencies. Standup provides a platform for clear communication and a sense of ownership and accountability for tasks across the team.

## Show and tell sessions

A regular session, usually at the same time and location during each sprint, to share project updates and progress with key stakeholders and the wider organisation. This is timeboxed to around 20-minutes so to be concise and cover the most important elements. The show and tell is a platform to gather feedback and answer any questions from those who aren’t a part of the core project team.

## Sprint retrospectives

At the end of each sprint, the team engages in a retrospective to reflect on the previous sprint. Facilitated by the Scrum Master, a retrospective can take many formats, typically with the core team sharing:

* What went well;
* What didn’t go so well; and
* What could be improved in the following sprint
