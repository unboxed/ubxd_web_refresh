# Team communication toolkit
To ensure for effective communication across the team, we work with a number of online, collaborative and cloud-based tools. Over time, we’ve introduced and discontinued a range of different tools, depending on their suitability for what we’re looking to achieve.

Here are some of the tools which currently form our team communication toolkit:


## Slack
[Slack](https://slack.com/) is our tool of choice for day-to-day team communication and conversation (both team and one-to-one). A dedicated account or channel is set up for each project, with invites sent to the core and wider teams for wide contribution and full visibility.

## Google Drive
For storing and sharing project files and documents, [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) provides an open and collaborative storage and backup. At the beginning of a project, a project folder is added for the team to begin working with.

## Trello
For every project, an online project management board is created, usually [Trello](https://trello.com/) or [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/), to keep track of progress. Each task assigned to a card, with each card assigned to the team members working on this task.

## Appear.in
When one or more members of the team may be working off-site or remotely, we use video conferencing tools such as [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) or [Appear.in](https://appear.in/) for daily standup and catch up conversations.
