# Teamwork and collaboration

A well-formed team is central to our process. Our teams are cross-functional, highly collaborative and autonomous. This gives them the ability to respond to changes quickly and deliver value in an optimum way.

## Cross-functional teams

Our cross-functional teams typically include at least one or two developers, a designer, a Scrum Master and a Product Owner (the Product Owner is usually the role of our customer). We also have access to experts from other areas related to the product or service in question. A breadth of backgrounds gives the team the ability to quickly answer questions related to technical, design, or business-related issues, reducing the risk of spending too much time on the wrong thing.

## Collaborative and self-organised

To get the most out of their cross-functional expertise, we encourage teams to be highly collaborative and self-organised. Co-location and face-to-face conversations are preferred whenever possible. We talk in person to get things done, rather than ping tickets to each other in a ticketing system. We pay attention when something needs to be discussed, rather than wait for a scheduled meeting. This leads to healthier relationships and makes people feel empowered and motivated.

## Open communication

Respecting the diversity of the teamâ€™s experience and opinion plays a fundamental role in the way that we communicate both internally and with customers. We invite our customers to be part of our team and we often work from their offices, as and when needed. We collaborate openly and encourage them to break down any communication barriers with their internal project stakeholders too. This means having frank conversations and establishing a trusting relationship.
