# Template library

There are a number of templates that our teams find helpful to use when working on projects, as well as share and use with our customers.

Weâ€™ve began building up a library of these templates:

## User persona

Use this template to begin empathising with users and focus on their user needs through the design process. Personas represent typical users or project stakeholders, grouped by shared needs and interests, common behavior patterns, or demographic and geographical similarities.
